## Elaboration of Statistical Approach

1. Does the valenced nature of AI-partner communication influence shared physiological arousal during a collaborative problem-solving task?
	- 2-part question:
		- WITHIN-GROUP (neutral vs valenced) → trial-by-trial
			- 2 levels / repeated measures!!
			- N / V
			- Is the PRESENCE of valenced interactions/comments/feedback by the AI reflected in changes to the extent or dynamical structure of shared physiological arousal (e.g., change in RR, DET, ENT, LAM) during a collaborative problem-solving task?
		- BETWEEN-GROUP (positive vs negative)
			- 2 levels / independent groups
			- V = P / V = N
			- Compared to positively valenced AI communication (friendly condition), does the presence of negatively valenced AI interactions (disagreeable condition) during a collaborative problem solving task correspond to differences in the extent or dynamical structure of shared physiological arousal (e.g., difference in RR, DET, ENT, LAM)?
    

- Statistical Approach
    

1. PART 1 (within) → repeated-measures MANOVA for each GROUP
    

- 2 measurement points
    
- IV = presence of valenced feedback (yes/no)
    
- DV = various CRQA outcomes aggregated for each task (TBD)
    
- possible need for non-parametric alternatives
    

1. multiple Friedman tests?
    

3. PART 2 (between) → separate MANOVA for each task
    

- 2 independent groups
    
- IV = emotional valence (positive/negative)
    
- DV = various CRQA outcomes aggregated for each task (TBD)
    
- possible need for non-parametric alternatives
    

1. Multivariate Kruskal-Wallis (MKW) test?
    

  
  
  

Order by condition interaction

condition interaction → differential transformation effect

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

2. Does the valenced nature of AI-partner communication (a) impact role-specific communicative influence, and (b) is this relationship mediated by changes in the extent and/or dynamical structure of shared physiological arousal?
    

- 4-part question:
    

1. WITHIN-GROUP (neutral vs valenced) → trial-by-trial
    

- 2 levels / repeated measures 
    
- Part A → Is the PRESENCE of valenced interactions/comments/feedback by the AI reflected in quantitative changes in the role-specific communicative influence during a collaborative problem-solving task?
    
- Part B → Does the relationship between trial condition and change in role-specific communicative influence change significantly after controlling for changes in the extent and dynamical structure of shared physiological arousal?
    

3. BETWEEN-GROUP (positive vs negative)
    

- 2 levels / independent groups
    
- V = P / V = N
    
- Part A → Compared to positively valenced AI communication (friendly condition), does the presence of negatively valenced AI interactions (disagreeable condition) correspond to differences in groups’ relative distribution of role-specific communicative influence during collaborative problem solving tasks?
    
- Part B → Does the relationship between group condition and relative distribution of role-specific communicative influence change after controlling for differences in the extent and dynamical structure of groups’ physiological arousal during collaborative problem solving tasks?
    

5. Statistical Approach
    

- PART 1 (within) → multiple regression model, mediator analysis
    

1. IV = presence of valenced feedback (yes/no)
    
2. DV = role-specific communicative influence
    
3. Mediator variables = various CRQA outcomes aggregated for each task (TBD, maybe 3-4?)
    
4. possible need for a general mixed model to account for random factor (participants) due to repeated measures of IV?
    

- PART 2 (between) → multiple regression model, mediator analysis
    

1. IV = emotional valence (positive/negative)
    
2. DV = role-specific communicative influence
    
3. Mediator variables = various CRQA outcomes aggregated for each task (TBD)
    

  

3. Can measures of team-level physiological synchrony - as well as the distribution of role-specific communicative influence - (a) predict team task performance, and (b) is this relationship moderated by the valenced nature of AI feedback?
    

- Part A → Along with the extent or dynamical structure of shared physiological arousal (e.g., change in RR, DET, ENT, LAM), does the distribution of role-specific communicative influence during collaborative problem-solving tasks predict team task performance?
    
- 2-part question:
    

1. WITHIN-GROUP (neutral vs valenced) → trial-by-trial
    

- 2 levels / repeated measures
    
- Are the relationships between team task performance and both shared physiological arousal and (the distribution of) role-specific communicative influence moderated by the PRESENCE of valenced interactions with the AI?
    

3. BETWEEN-GROUP (positive vs negative)
    

- 2 levels / independent groups
    
- V = P / V = N
    
- Are the relationships between team task performance and both shared physiological arousal and (the distribution of) role-specific communicative influence moderated by the emotional valence of the AI interactions?
    

5. Statistical Approach
    

- Multiple regression models, moderator analysis
    

1. IV = various CRQA outcomes aggregated for each task (TBD), role-specific communicative influence
    

1. maybe 4 total measures?
    

3. DV = task performance (rating TBD)
    
4. LOOK AT INTERACTION TERMS
    

- PART 1 (within)  
    

1. Moderator variable = presence of valenced feedback (yes/no)
    
2. possible need for a general mixed model to account for random factor (participants) due to repeated measures of IV?
    

- PART 2 (between) 
    

1. Moderator variable = emotional valence (positive/negative)
    

  

4. Do individual measures of perceived rapport, satisfaction with collaboration & performance, and self-report emotional state (a) reflect team-level task performance, and (b) is the relationship between team performance and these measures of subjective appraisal mediated by the distribution of role-specific communicative influence and shared physiological arousal?
    

- Along with self-report emotional state, do individual appraisals of rapport, collaboration, and performance following collaborative problem-solving tasks ‘predict’ team task performance?
    
- 2-part question:
    

1. WITHIN-GROUP (neutral vs valenced) → trial-by-trial
    

- 2 levels / repeated measures
    
- Are the relationships between team task performance and subjective appraisal measures mediated by the relative distribution of role-specific communicative influence and/or shared physiological arousal?
    

3. BETWEEN-GROUP (positive vs negative)
    

- 2 levels / independent groups
    
- V = P / V = N
    
- Are the relationships between team task performance and subjective appraisal measures mediated by differences in groups’ distribution of role-specific communicative influence and/or shared physiological arousal during valenced task conditions?
    

5. Statistical Approach
    

- Multiple regression model, mediator analysis
    

1. IV = individual measures of perceived rapport (with AI and human); satisfaction with collaboration, performance, and platform; self-report emotional state (6 predictors)
    
2. DV = team task performance
    

- PART 1 (within)  
    

1. Mediator variables = various CRQA outcomes aggregated for each task (TBD), distribution (ratio) of role-specific communicative influence for each task?
    
2. possible need for a general mixed model to account for random factor (participants) due to repeated measures?
    

- PART 2 (between)  
    

1. Mediator variables = between-group differences in various CRQA outcomes aggregated for each task (TBD), between-group differences in distribution (ratio) of role-specific communicative influence for each valenced condition?
    

  

Exploratory

5. What is the relationship between communicative influence and strength of physiological synchrony? Do changes in synchrony precede changes in influence, vice versa, or is there evidence of circular causality? (Move window analysis)
    
6. leader-follower….
    

Does the relationship between communicative influence and strength of physiological synchrony change over the course of the task, and are differences in this relationship preceded by changes in physiological synchrony…?
