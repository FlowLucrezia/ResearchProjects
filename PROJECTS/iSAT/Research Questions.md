RQ1: Does the valenced nature of AI-partner communication influence shared physiological arousal during a collaborative problem-solving task?

RQ2: Does the valenced nature of AI-partner communication (a) impact role-specific communicative influence, and (b) is this relationship mediated by changes in the extent and/or dynamical structure of shared physiological arousal?

RQ3: Can measures of team-level physiological synchrony - as well as the distribution of role-specific communicative influence - (a) predict team task performance, and (b) are these relationships moderated by the valenced nature of AI feedback?

RQ4: Do individual measures of perceived rapport, satisfaction with collaboration & performance, and self-report emotional state (a) reflect team-level task performance, and (b) is the relationship between team performance and these measures of subjective appraisal mediated by the distribution of role-specific communicative influence and shared physiological arousal?
