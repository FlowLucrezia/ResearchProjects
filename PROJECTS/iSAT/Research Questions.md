### Original Set

RQ1: Does the valenced nature of AI-partner communication influence shared physiological arousal during a collaborative problem-solving task?

RQ2: Does the valenced nature of AI-partner communication (a) impact role-specific communicative influence, and (b) is this relationship mediated by changes in the extent and/or dynamical structure of shared physiological arousal?

RQ3: Can measures of team-level physiological synchrony - as well as the distribution of role-specific communicative influence - (a) predict team task performance, and (b) are these relationships moderated by the valenced nature of AI feedback?

RQ4: Do individual measures of perceived rapport, satisfaction with collaboration & performance, and self-report emotional state (a) reflect team-level task performance, and (b) is the relationship between team performance and these measures of subjective appraisal mediated by the distribution of role-specific communicative influence and shared physiological arousal?

### FYP Focus (February 2025)

RQ1: Does the valenced nature of AI-partner communication influence the extent of shared physiological arousal during a collaborative problem-solving task? 

RQ2: To what extent does team-level physiological synchrony relate to team task performance, and does the AI feedback condition moderate this relationship?

RQ3: Do team- and individual-level subjective measures of empathy, after controlling for the effect of AI feedback condition, predict the extent of physiological synchrony throughout the task?

RQ4: To what extent does team-level physiological synchrony relate to team- and individual-level subjective measures of rapport, and does empathy moderate these relationships?

### FYP Focus (March 2025)

RQ1: Does the valenced nature of AI-partner communication influence the extent of shared physiological arousal during a collaborative problem-solving task? 

RQ2: Do team-level (aggregate) measures of empathy, after controlling for the effect of AI feedback condition, predict the extent of physiological synchrony throughout the task?

RQ3: Do differences between teammates' subjective measures of empathy, after controlling for the effect of AI feedback condition, predict the extent of physiological synchrony throughout the task?

RQ4: To what extent does team-level physiological synchrony relate to team- and individual-level subjective measures of rapport with a human teammate, and does empathy moderate these relationships?

RQ5: To what extent does team-level physiological synchrony relate to team- and individual-level subjective measures of rapport with an AI teammate, and does the valenced nature of AI feedback moderate these relationships?
