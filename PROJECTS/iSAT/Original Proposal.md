Multi-scaled socio-emotional regulation processes play a key role in cooperative activity, as shared emotional experiences have been linked to enhance engagement and improve learning outcomes (Järvelä et al., 2016), and the dynamic evolution of collaborative behavioral states of teams has been shown to be influenced by ==link to emotions and individual communicative influence, maybe roles? (e.g., Dindar et al., 2022; Lämsä et al., 2024; @@@). look at what you say vs what you do paper!!!== Importantly, shared physiological responses such as synchrony in electrodermal and cardiac activity have also been linked to better team performance (Palumbo et al., 2017; Gordon et al., 2021; Chikersal et al., 2017). By integrating metrics that reflect interactive states of collaborative activity (i.e, real-time physiological and communication data) with self-report methods, this study will explore how collective patterns of socio-metacognitive sense-making and socio-emotional regulation shape individual contributions to (and experiences of) collaborative problem solving (Borge et al., 2019; Molinari et al., 2013), in addition to how these interactive states may point to differences in task performance. 

The implementation of our measurement framework and hypotheses, as outlined in Figures 1 and 2, offers the potential to provide valuable insights into how emotional tones of AI in student-AI teams and the diversity of team roles affect collaborative dynamics and learning outcomes. These insights could inform the design of future student-AI team learning systems that optimize real-time role adaptability and emotional feedback to promote equitable and effective collaboration (Reitman et al., in press). Specifically, in this study, we will examine how role-specific communicative influence and shared emotions (i.e., physiological arousal) are impacted by the emotional character of AI feedback, as well as how these metrics might jointly impact participants' subjective appraisals (including perceived rapport, collaboration, and emotion states) and overall performance on a collaborative problem-solving (CPS) task performed in student-AI teams. To achieve this, we will employ the Wizard of Oz paradigm for the AI teammate and recruit two participants to engage in a coding learning task that consists of two subtasks. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a Controller (direct contributor) or Guide (indirect contributor) role, and teams will be randomly assigned to either positively or negatively valenced interaction conditions. The AI teammate will act as a secondary indirect contributor, providing neutral feedback during one subtask, and communicating either positive or negative feedback for the other subtask, depending on the condition assigned. 

The measurement framework for our proposed study (see Figure 1) builds on perspectives from interactive team cognition theory (Cooke et al., 2013) and team dynamics research (Gorman et al., 2020), emphasizing the importance of coordination, adaptability, and knowledge reorganization through ongoing collaboration at the team level, rather than mere aggregation of individual teammates' knowledge. This perspective posits that productive teamwork is driven by the ongoing, reciprocal interplay between explicit verbal communication about relational or task-relevant aspects of collaboration and implicit emotional sharing (e.g., shared physiological arousal). Here, communication is discussed in the context of how vocal and written interactions between team members result in the emergence of collective, collaborative behavior. The degree to which component behaviors (e.g., individual utterances or written contributions) have the capacity to change the global state of the system (e.g., patterns of CPS behavior at the team level) is hereafter referred to as influence. In this study, we will transcribe, diarize, and timestamp communication data from team tasks to generate individual speaker time series, indicating who is speaking and when. Communication time series will be annotated according to three categories of CPS interaction states (Sun et al., 2020), namely, Constructing Shared Knowledge (e.g., communicating ideas and expertise to others; establishing shared understanding), Negotiation (e.g., developing and executing team solutions; revising solutions as necessary), and Maintaining Team Function (e.g., distinct positive awareness of team belonging; proactive contribution to success of the team). As described by Reitman et al. (2024), communicative influence will then be calculated as the mutual information between an individual’s speech contributions and shifts in the team's CPS states. Investigations of team multimodal behavior during CPS have reported relationships between facets of CPS behavior and (ir)regularity of collective behavior (Amon et al., 2019; ==@@@==), highlighting that temporal patterns in communication and physiological responses (e.g., synchrony or desynchrony) can serve as indicators of team cohesion and performance (Dindar et al., 2020; Palumbo et al., 2017). With regard to emotional sharing between team members, physiological synchrony has also been linked to the building of joint understanding and empathy in the context of collaborative learning (e.g., Haataja et al., 2018; ==@@@ for empathy, see Jarvela paper for references)==, and shared arousal events have been shown to assist in detecting CPS phases (e.g., Dindar et al., 2022; Lämsä et al., 2024). As an interactive state representative of shared arousal between team members during collaborative activity, physiological synchrony will be operationalized in terms of its strength (i.e, windowed cross-correlations, WCC) (e.g., Behrens et al., 2020; Gordon et al., 2020), as well as its regularity (determinism, DET; e.g., Mønster et al., 2016; Gorman et al., 2020), complexity (entropy, ENT; e.g., ==see Arellano & Veliz paper later), flexibility (i.e, laminarity, LAM; e.g., @@@) and dynamic stability (mean line length, MnL; e.g., @@@),== based on cross-recurrence quantification recurrence analysis (CRQA) of coupled dyads’ ECG and EDA activity time series.

Interactions between behavioral and affective processes during collaborative activity may be influenced by established team roles and the emotional nature of AI contributions (Mallick et al., 2024; Dindar et al., 2020), with team dynamics continuously reshaping as members respond to emotionally varied AI feedback. Broadly, we hypothesize that AI feedback with varied emotional tones will modulate communicative influence, as emotional tones in communication have been shown to impact interpersonal dynamics - enhancing engagement and collaboration, or eliciting self- & group-level regulation of undesirable emotions states (Järvelä et al., 2016; Arimoto & Okanoya, 2014; Mänty et al., 2020). Previous research has suggested that higher physiological synchrony between teammates often correlates with improved collaboration, coordination, and trust, especially in high-stakes or emotionally charged tasks (Palumbo et al., 2017; Mønster et al., 2016; ==@@@==), and that emotion trigger events can be identified in the physiological synchrony of group members [@lamsaLearnersLinguisticAlignment2024]. Thus, we anticipate that the presence (and valence) of an emotional tone in AI communications to the team will affect synchronization of physiological responses among human teammates, which may in turn mediate differences in individual and group-level regulatory processes (i.e., communicative influence, CPS behaviors) in response to the emergent emotional climate of the collaborative task (see Figure 2). Specifically, positive AI feedback is expected to promote emotional engagement and more balanced participation through the mediatory effects of enhanced emotional state matching between team members (e.g., greater physiological synchrony). On the other hand, negative or neutral AI feedback may skew influence toward a few individuals, leading to role consolidation, where one member dominates the interaction [@dindarWhatDoesPhysiological2020], and lead to diminished perceptions of collaboration and trust within the team. We will therefore also test the hypotheses that the interaction between team roles and the emotional tone of AI feedback predicts objective measures of task performance, with the expectation that subjective ratings of both collaboration and rapport and self-report emotions moderate the strength of this relationship (see Figure 2). Finally, we will explore how AI’s emotional tone may impact leader-follower communication and arousal patterns using Diagonal Cross-Recurrence Profile (DCRP) Analysis [@richardsonLookingUnderstandCoupling2005] [@wallotAnalyzingMultivariateDynamics2018], building on previous studies that emphasize the role of emotional mimicry in leadership development [@paulMutabilityCharismaLeadership2002] [@dindarLeadersFollowersIdentified2022].
