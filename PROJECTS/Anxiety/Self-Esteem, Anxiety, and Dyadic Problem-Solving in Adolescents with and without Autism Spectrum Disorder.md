Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by repetitive behaviors and impairments in social communication, impacting learning and social functioning. Adolescents with ASD often experience fewer peer relationships, which can negatively influence their self-perceptions. They also exhibit challenges in interpersonal interactions, including inattentiveness to nonverbal cues, rigid social play, and reduced prosocial behaviors. Cognitive-behavioral inflexibility, including insistence on sameness and intolerance to uncertainty, is common in this population and is linked to anxiety and social skills. Despite increasing inclusion in mainstream schools, many adolescents with ASD remain socially and emotionally excluded, reporting lower social competence than their typically developing (TD) peers. This social exclusion can contribute to low self-esteem, problem behaviors, and emotional disturbances. Communication difficulties, rigidity, and fewer friendships also increase the risk of bullying victimization in this group.

Collaborative problem-solving requires mutual engagement, coordination, and cooperation towards a joint goal. Social interactions in this context are influenced by individuals' perceptions, capabilities, and cognitive-behavioral states, evolving dynamically. Research suggests that the success of dyadic cooperation is linked to the coordination of various aspects like language and attention. However, recent studies indicate that weakly-coupled dyads might perform better, and coordination levels are related to task performance. The influence of coordination is also mediated by task difficulty and individual cognitive abilities.

Self-esteem evolves through dynamic interactions of contextual, socio-cultural, physiological, and psychological variables. 'Trait' self-esteem is relatively stable but can change over time, while 'state' self-esteem fluctuates and is influenced by external and internal factors. The temporal structuring of state self-esteem exhibits fractal patterns, indicative of self-organizing dynamics. Anxiety, particularly social anxiety, plays a critical role in mediating the relationships between emotional processing, communication skills, self-esteem, and psychosocial functioning, all often affected in individuals with ASD. Anxiety can be considered a self-organizing process involving micro-level emotional experiences, meso-level anxious moods, and macro-level trait anxiety.

This study aims to investigate the dynamic interplay between self-esteem, anxiety, and dyadic problem-solving in adolescents with and without ASD, utilizing a complex dynamic systems (CDS) perspective. This approach focuses on patterns of change over time at an individual level, treating time as a background parameter for observing emergent patterns.


This study aims to investigate how TD and autistic adolescents evolve with respect to:

1. The organized, dynamic nature of their state self-esteem and anxiety.
2. How temporal structuring at the state level influences the development of trait or ‘baseline’ properties of these variables.
3. Whether the nature and developmental trajectories of these state/trait measures (at the intra- and inter- individual level) is reflected in the patterns of dyadic interaction in a cooperative problem-solving context.
4. Whether there are relationships between the intrinsic dynamics of state self-esteem/anxiety throughout adolescence and patterns of behavioral coupling during a dyadic problem-solving task.
5. Whether differences in these interactions might be explained or mediated by macro-level levels or changes in self-esteem or social anxiety.

### Research Questions

1. How do the temporal dynamics (variability and complexity) of state self-esteem and anxiety differ between typically developing (TD) adolescents and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?
2. What are the relationships between the temporal characteristics of state self-esteem and anxiety and the development of their corresponding trait levels in TD and ASD adolescents over time?
3. What are the characteristic patterns of dyadic interaction (collaboration vs. independence) during a cooperative problem-solving task in dyads of ASD adolescents compared to dyads of TD adolescents?
4. How are the temporal dynamics of individual state self-esteem and anxiety related to the emergent patterns of behavioral coupling in dyadic interactions for both TD and ASD adolescents?
5. To what extent do macro-level factors such as trait self-esteem and social anxiety influence and mediate the relationships between the temporal dynamics of state self-esteem/anxiety and the patterns of dyadic interaction, and do mediation effects differ between TD and ASD adolescents?

### Hypotheses

- Temporal Structure of State Self-Esteem and Anxiety:
	- TD adolescents will exhibit state self-esteem and anxiety time series with less variability (lower standard deviations) and more complex temporal patterning (FD closer to 1.2, approaching pink noise) compared to adolescents with ASD.
	- Adolescents with ASD will exhibit state self-esteem and anxiety time series with greater variability (higher standard deviations) and more rigid, structured temporal patterning (FD  approaching Brownian noise) compared to TD adolescents.

- Influence of State-Level Patterns on Trait-Level Measures:
	- For TD adolescents, higher flexibility/adaptability of state self-esteem (Fractal Dimension closer to pink noise) will be positively associated with higher levels of trait self-esteem.
	- For adolescents with ASD, a greater decrease in trait self-esteem over the study period will be related to reduced complexity (inflexibility) of state self-esteem.
	- For all adolescents:
		- Higher levels of trait anxiety (general and social) will be associated with lower levels of complexity (FD approaching Brownian noise) in the state anxiety time series. This relationship is expected to be stronger for social anxiety than general anxiety in autistic individuals.
		- Greater increases in trait anxiety (general and/or social) over the study period will be associated with higher variability and rigidity/inflexibility of state anxiety fluctuations.
		- Greater predictability (less complexity) of the state self-esteem series will be associated with higher trait anxiety (general/social).
		- Proximity to pink noise of the state anxiety time series will be positively related to higher trait self-esteem.

- Dyadic Interaction Patterns in Collaborative Problem-Solving:
	- For all dyads (ASD-ASD and TD-TD), the recurrence measures (RR_O and RR_LOS) for collaborative work (CW) will be higher than for independent work (IW) and no work (NW).
	- ASD-ASD dyads will exhibit relatively higher RR_O and RR_LOS for IW and lower RR_O and RR_LOS for CW compared to TD-TD pairs.
	- ASD-ASD dyads will exhibit higher values (and less change over time) of trapping time (TT) and Max Vertical Line (MAXVL) measures for all behavioral modes compared to TD-TD pairs. This suggests that individuals with ASD will gravitate more towards independent work, be less flexible in switching between behavioral states, and remain in a given state longer.
	- Over the four testing sessions, MAXVL and TT measures for both CW and IW will decrease, while Entropy of Vertical Lines (ENTVL) will increase for both ASD-ASD and TD-TD dyads, reflecting increased flexibility and complexity of dyadic interactions over time.

- Relationships Between Intrinsic Dynamics and Behavioral Coupling:
	- Higher complexity, overall behavioral coupling, and coupling at the same time for CW behaviors (higher RR_O, RR_LOS, and ENTVL for CW) will be correlated with better task performance (more puzzles solved) across all time points.
	- Greater flexibility of both IW and CW attractor states (lower TT and MAXVL) will be correlated with better task performance across all time points.
	- The relationship between the complexity and stability of CW and IW attractor states and overall task performance may differ between ASD-ASD and TD-TD dyads.

- Mediation by Macro-Level Self-Esteem and Social Anxiety:
	- Lower mean levels of trait self-esteem and higher mean levels of trait anxiety (general and social) will be inversely related to the strength, stability, and complexity of both CW and IW attractor states.
	- Higher levels of variability and rigidity (lower complexity) in state self-esteem and anxiety time series will be inversely associated with the strength, stability, and complexity of the CW attractor.
	- The strength of the associations between trait self-esteem/anxiety and dyadic interaction patterns may differ between TD and ASD groups, especially over the four testing sessions.

### Methods

Approximately 40 adolescents (9-10 years old) will be recruited from mainstream public schools, with an equal number of TD children and children diagnosed with ASD by a clinical psychologist. Participants will be paired within their own group (ASD-ASD or TD-TD) for a tangram problem-solving task, matched based on individual baseline performance on the task. Baseline individual tangram task performance will be assessed two weeks prior to the study. Trait questionnaires will be administered in person during the dyadic problem-solving sessions. State self-esteem and anxiety questionnaires will be completed remotely twice daily. Dyadic tangram sessions will be video-recorded for subsequent coding of interaction behaviors.

Measures
- Trait Self-Esteem: Rosenberg’s Self-Esteem Scale (RSE) will be administered at four time points (separated by four months).
- State Self-Esteem: The 20-item State Self-Esteem Scale (SSES) will be administered twice daily for 512 days via mobile devices or laptops using a visual analog scale (0-10).
- Social Anxiety: The Social Anxiety Scale for Children-revised will be administered at four time points.
- Trait and State Anxiety: The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAI-C) will be used to measure both trait and state anxiety at four time points (trait) and twice daily for 512 days (state), using a visual analog scale (0-10).
- Dyadic Interaction: Participants will complete a 15-minute digital tangram puzzle task in pairs across four sessions (separated by approximately four months). Video recordings will be coded second-by-second for five interaction behaviors: no engagement, passive work, imitative work, parallel work, and collaborative work. These will be further categorized into collaborative work (CW), independent work (IW), and no work (NW) for analysis.
  

Time series data for state self-esteem and anxiety will be analyzed using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to examine long-range dependencies and calculate fractal dimensions (FD). The shuffled slopes method will be used to determine if the temporal structure is non-random. Coded dyadic interaction behaviors will be analyzed using CRQA to quantify the dynamics between the coupled systems. Measures such as recurrence rate (RR), entropy of vertical lines (ENTVL), max vertical line (MAXVL), laminarity (LAM), and trapping time (TT) will be calculated for different behavioral states (CW, IW, NW). Shuffled time series will be used to assess the non-randomness of the coupling.

Individual and group-level analyses will be performed to compare trait and state measures, fractal scaling exponents, and CRQA outcomes between TD and ASD adolescents across the four time points. Correlations and regression analyses will be used to examine relationships between these variables and task performance.

Inferential Analyses

- Comparing Groups at Baseline:
	- Independent samples t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests (if data are not normally distributed) to compare the mean scores of trait self-esteem, trait social anxiety, and trait general anxiety between the TD and ASD groups at the initial assessment.
	- Similar tests could be used to compare baseline performance on the individual tangram task to ensure matching was effective.

- Longitudinal Changes in Trait Measures:
	- Repeated measures ANOVA with Group (TD vs. ASD) as a between-subjects factor and Time (four assessment points) as a within-subjects factor to examine how trait self-esteem and trait anxiety (social and general) change over time in both groups and whether the patterns of change differ significantly between the groups.
	- Post-hoc tests (e.g., Bonferroni correction) can be used to identify specific time points at which significant differences occur between groups or within groups across time.
    

- Analyzing State Self-Esteem and Anxiety Dynamics:
	- Comparison of Fractal Dimensions (FD): Independent samples t-tests or non-parametric tests (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum test) to compare the mean FD values for state self-esteem and state anxiety between the TD and ASD groups. This will assess differences in the rigidity/complexity of these fluctuations.

- Analyzing Dyadic Interaction Patterns (CRQA Measures):
	- Comparison of CRQA Outcomes: For each of the four interaction sessions, use MANOVA or separate ANOVAs with Group as a between-subjects factor to compare the mean values of the CRQA measures (RR_O, RR_LOS, ENTVL, MAXVL, TT) for the different behavioral states (CW, IW, NW) between the TD-TD and ASD-ASD dyads.
	- Longitudinal Analysis of CRQA Outcomes: Use repeated measures ANOVA with Group as a between-subjects factor and Session (four time points) as a within-subjects factor to examine how CRQA measures for CW and IW evolve over the four sessions in both groups of dyads. Look for significant Group x Session interaction effects to determine if the developmental trajectories of these interaction patterns differ.

- Relationships Between State/Trait Measures and Dyadic Interaction:
	- Correlation Analyses: Calculate Pearson or Spearman correlations to examine the relationships between mean levels and variability (e.g., standard deviation) of state self-esteem and anxiety, fractal dimensions of state measures, and trait self-esteem/anxiety scores with the CRQA measures (e.g., RR for CW, TT for IW) at each time point. Do these correlations differ between the TD and ASD groups?
	- Regression Analyses: Use multiple regression to predict CRQA outcomes (e.g., RR for CW) based on trait self-esteem, trait anxiety, and potentially fractal dimensions of state measures, examining if group membership moderates these relationships.

- Mediation Analyses:
	- Explore if trait self-esteem or social anxiety mediate the relationship between group membership (TD/ASD) and specific dyadic interaction patterns (e.g., proportion of collaborative work, CRQA measures of coupling in CW). This would help understand if differences in self-esteem or anxiety contribute to the observed differences in how the groups interact.

- Relationship with Task Performance:
	- Correlation and Regression Analyses: Correlate CRQA measures for collaborative work (e.g., RR_LOS for CW, ENTVL for CW) with the number of tangram puzzles solved by the dyad at each time point. Use regression to predict task performance based on these interaction measures, and explore if these relationships differ between the ASD-ASD and TD-TD dyads.

### Expected Outcomes & Significance

  
It is expected that autistic adolescents will report lower mean trait and state self-esteem and higher mean trait and state anxiety compared to TD peers, with a potential decrease in self-esteem and increase in anxiety over time in the ASD group. Variability in these measures is anticipated to be higher in the ASD group, but the temporal patterning of state self-esteem and anxiety fluctuations is expected to be more rigid (higher FD). TD adolescents are expected to show more flexible and complex patterning (FD closer to pink noise). Positive associations are predicted between trait self-esteem and the flexibility of state self-esteem, and between trait anxiety and rigidity of state anxiety.

In the dyadic task, ASD-ASD dyads are hypothesized to exhibit higher recurrence for independent work (IW) and lower recurrence for collaborative work (CW) compared to TD-TD dyads, along with higher TT and MAXVL values, indicating a stronger tendency towards independent work and less flexibility in switching between behavioral states. Over time, an increase in complexity and flexibility of dyadic interactions (increased ENTVL, decreased TT and MAXVL) is expected in both groups, potentially to varying degrees. Task performance (number of puzzles solved) is predicted to be correlated with higher complexity and coupling of CW behaviors and greater flexibility of both CW and IW states. Relationships between self-esteem/anxiety trajectories and the strength, stability, and complexity of attractor states in dyadic interactions are also anticipated, potentially differing between the ASD and TD groups.

This research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic interplay between self-esteem, anxiety, and social interaction in adolescents with and without ASD. By utilizing a complex dynamic systems approach and advanced time-series analysis techniques, this study aims to elucidate the temporal structuring of these constructs and their influence on collaborative problem-solving behaviors. The findings may have implications for developing targeted interventions to enhance social competence, self-esteem, and reduce anxiety in adolescents with ASD, ultimately promoting better social inclusion and psychological well-being.
