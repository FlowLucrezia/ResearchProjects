## Self-Esteem, Anxiety, and Dyadic Problem-Solving in Adolescents with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder

## Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by repetitive patterns of behavior and impairments in social communication that can impede learning and overall social functioning[1]. Individuals with this disorder experience a general lack of peer relationships[2-7] that can influence their self-perceptions[8-13], in addition to impairments in several aspects of interpersonal interaction such as inattentiveness to the nonverbal behaviors of others (i.e, pointing, eye contact, expressions, gestures, shared intentions)[14-21], rigid participation patterns of social play[22,23], and reduced initiation and maintenance of prosocial behaviors[23-26]. Children with ASD also characteristically exhibit cognitive-behavioral inflexibility[27-29]  that is related to their insistence on sameness (aversion to altering repetitive behaviors) and intolerance to uncertainty - which are factors considered to be intimately linked to anxiety and social skills in this population[30-34]. Importantly, while students with ASD are increasingly likely to be included into ‘regular’ school settings, it is suggested that many remain socially and emotionally excluded; they have fewer reciprocal friendships than typically developing (TD) classmates, are more likely to be isolated, and consider themselves less socially competent than their peers[2-8].  Having fewer opportunities to participate in social or play settings with peers may further contribute to the developmental deficiencies observed in interpersonal interactions, thereby perpetuating a cycle of social exclusion, low self-esteem, problem-behaviors, and emotional disturbance[5-11,34-37]. Communication problems, rigidity and repetitiveness of behaviors, and having fewer friendships are also considered to account for the high risk of bullying victimization in adolescents with ASD[38-43]. 

Lack of peer acceptance and an elevated risk of bullying in school are thought to contribute to the higher prevalence of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem in this population[38-40,44-54]. Self-esteem is broadly defined as an evaluation of one’s value or worth as a person[55-57], and the valence and stability of self-esteem has been frequently linked to psychological functioning, mood, and personality traits[9-12,58-71]. People with higher self-esteem are typically happier and more likely to have close friendships[9-11,72], while low self-esteem is one of the strongest predictors of emotional and behavioral problems[73-75]. In children and adolescents with autism, low levels of self-esteem and social competence are common[7-9,13,69,74-76]. Poor self-esteem has been reported to predict behavioral problems independently of impaired emotion recognition in ASD[74]. Importantly, a clear link has been established between self-esteem development trajectories, elevated levels of anxiety in adolescence, and social competence[34,51-54,68-71]. There is evidence that high levels of anxiety may further contribute to behavioral and social difficulties in autistic individuals[6,48-53,77-81]. Wide estimates of anxiety have been reported (ranging from 11-84%) in children with ASD; this variability is commonly attributed to how anxiety is operationalized and assessed, as well as sample selection and size[34,48-53,78-80]. Symptoms of social or separation anxiety, such as avoiding social interaction or disruptive behavior in response to separation from a parent, are often difficult to differentiate from symptoms of ASD[6,34,48,50,78-81]. Common characteristics of ASD such as rigidity of behavior and ‘insistence on sameness’ are also considered to be manifestations of anxiety[30-34]. A growing emphasis has been placed on the impact of social anxiety in this population, as it appears to play a significant role in contributing to social difficulties in nearly half of children with ASD[6,47-53,78-81]. Social anxiety is considered to arise from a combination of withdrawal, disruptive behaviors, poor social skills, and unsuccessful social interactions - thereby perpetuating a cycle of social rejection and higher levels of anxiety symptoms[34,81-84]. Social rejection can further exacerbate mental health issues, low self-esteem, and communication difficulties by reducing opportunities to interact with peers (i.e, through avoidance, bullying or lack of peer acceptance) and impairing emotional processing[5-9,34-39,46-49,82-87]. 

The experience of interpersonal interactions is a foundation for social competence, self-esteem, and attitudes towards social contexts, which in turn play a constitutive role in how one behaves and experiences future social interactions[88-94]. In this way, self-esteem is viewed as an inherently socially constituted process that relies on the reciprocal influence of interpersonal experiences and one’s understanding of oneself in relation to others[56,72,92-99]. As school-aged children increasingly evaluate themselves by their relationships with peers and teachers in social, emotional, and physical aspects, adolescence is considered a critical period for the development of psychological functions and self-esteem[68-71,89-106]. Peer relations, social competence, and other cognitive-behavioral factors related to social functioning also play an important role in the emergence of general and social anxiety during adolescence[6,48-54,81-85,103-106]. Children who experience social impairments are often rejected by their peers, struggle with interpersonal communication, frequently exhibit disruptive behavior, and present with internalizing disorders such as depression and anxiety[5-9,13,35-37,54,70,75-84]. Such social impairments in autism can manifest as reduced initiation and maintenance of joint attention, social play, and helpful behaviors[21-26], which in turn are thought to contribute to relatively poor cooperative abilities in children with ASD[23-26]. As educational settings are placing continuously greater emphasis on cooperative problem-solving, students are being given more opportunities for goal-oriented interpersonal interaction[107-109]. Peer-based collaborative work is used in schools to promote the development of social and cognitive skills[110-116], and is considered important for achieving greater levels of reasoning, understanding, or performance compared to working individually[116-121]. Collaboration is generally preferable to working alone; better results are obtained and retention of task performance is superior after cooperating with others[110-114,116-119]. However, effective cooperation requires that individuals be able share goals/planning, attention, and intentions[21,107,120-123] - all of which are considered to be deficient in autism[14-21]. Indeed, students with ASD typically struggle more in collaborative situations than TD counterparts[21-26,37]; if school-children are not sufficiently prepared for these types of peer interactions and as a result have negative social experiences, it is possible that these situations may further exacerbate social avoidance, poor self-esteem, and social anxiety[34-37,81,92-94,101-106,123]. 

Collaborative problem-solving involves working together to solve a problem associated with a joint goal[107,109]. When two children collaborate to solve a problem, they must mutually engage, coordinate, and cooperate with one another[112,118]. Goal-directed interpersonal interactions are shaped by the perceptions, capabilities, and cognitive-behavioral states of the individuals engaged, all of which are dynamically evolving and synergistically influencing each other over time[103,124-127]. The non-linear, synergistic interactions between coupled individuals and contextual factors self-organize to give rise to adaptive or maladaptive behaviors[126-129]. Therefore, the study of social interactions (such as in the context of collaboration) requires a process-oriented approach that acknowledges the complex, transient nature of human behavior in these settings. Research utilizing techniques such as cross-recurrence quantification analysis attempts to characterize the temporal dynamics of interpersonal processes by examining real-time social behavior of coupled individuals[130-140]. Success of dyadic cooperation, as well as the development of healthy social connections, is proposed to be linked to the synchronization (or alignment)[140-145] and complementarity[146-155] of language structures, gaze, attention, internal states, and perceptual-motor mechanisms such as postural sway. However, recent studies examining cooperative problem-solving in children determined that weakly-coupled or less synchronized dyads performed better, and that the level of coordination was related to task performance[151-155]. For this reason, it has been suggested that task performance may be more related to the structural organization of recurrent cognitive-behavioral patterns (or coordination as opposed to synchronization) in dyads consisting of TD children as well as those with neurodevelopmental disorders[112,126,138,154-157]. One study focusing on interpersonal coordination in TD children over six sessions of a dyadic problem-solving task distinguished between distributed dyadic interactions (both children contribute equally to a solution), and unequal dyadic interactions (only one child contributes actively to the solution)[156]. In their study, the children were more strongly coordinated to the distributed dyadic interactions, and showed increasingly flexible and complex interactions over time. The authors suggested that the decrease in coupling and increase in complexity over time for both interaction types may have been an adaptive response to increasing task difficulty[156]. Indeed, the influence of interpersonal coordination in a problem-solving context is considered to be mediated by task difficulty, feedback or instructions provided, and the cognitive abilities of the interacting individuals as they relate to the needs of the task[117-123,153-159].

Tangram puzzle games have been applied extensively in several mediums (i.e, mixed-reality, tablet applications, virtual computer environments) to evaluate engagement, synchronization, and collaborative strategies in children with and without neurodevelopmental disorders[153-155,160-168]. These puzzles require players to assemble a specific shape from seven flat pieces available, and are commonly used in educational settings to promote spatial reasoning, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills[167-171]. Despite the increasing popularity and development of virtual tangram puzzle games for children with ASD, no studies have implemented a tangram task to specifically examine the dynamic structuring of collaborative and independent problem-solving behavior in this population. In other experimental paradigms, autistic children have been reported to exhibit cognitive and behavioral inflexibility, difficulties in switching strategies during cooperative games, and less effort in re-engaging and cooperating with a partner once an interaction has ended[23-29]. As adapting to an unfamiliar social situation - especially in a goal-oriented context - requires some level of cognitive-behavioral flexibility[107-110,113-115,120-123], the characteristic insistence on sameness and repetition in this population may interfere with the success of social interactions[27-33,172]. For this reason, children with ASD may prefer to play or engage with a task independently instead of engaging with peers[5-7,104-106]. This pattern of isolation and withdrawal limits the opportunities for the development of social and communicative skills, thereby promoting a cycle of social anxiety, avoidance, and impaired social competence[5-10,34-37,78-88,103-106]. The quality of social interactions (i.e, coordination, flexibility, positive vs negative experiences) is important for creating and maintaining successful relationships (among other aspects of learning and development)[2-11,27,103,106-116,123], and social competence is fundamentally mediated by self-esteem and social anxiety[35-37,73-85,88,93,94,102-106]. It is therefore of relevance to gain an understanding of how self-esteem and/or manifestations of anxiety in autistic adolescents might mutually influence the dynamics of interpersonal interactions over the course of development. 

The evolution of self-esteem over development is considered to arise from the dynamic interactions between contextual, socio-cultural, physiological, and psychological variables at various levels and scales of analysis[95-99]. Research focusing on ‘trait’ self-esteem  - which is considered a relatively predictable aspect of self-esteem associated with self-concept or identity[55] - has determined that trait self-esteem can change over an individual’s life span as a function of life events, cognitive-behavioral factors, and age itself[55-57,68-73,89-101]. The variability and stability of self-esteem in response to external perturbations has been associated with hostility, reactions to evaluative feedback, self-concept clarity, and social anxiety[58-68]. As such, there is now growing interest on the nature of a transient, fluctuating measure of self-esteem (‘state’ self-esteem)[12,173-176]  that is influenced by both external factors (extrinsic dynamics) and previous evaluation of oneself (intrinsic dynamics)[95-99,103,177-180]. With respect to its intrinsic dynamics, temporal structuring and long-term inter-dependencies of state self-esteem time series have been increasingly reported in the literature[178-186]. Fractal (1/f) scaling properties of the fluctuations in these time series are indicative of emergent, self-organizing dynamics that are embedded within inter-connected levels of change[184-186]. A fairly recent model was proposed to explain and predict the self-organizing dynamics of self-esteem[178] that has described this phenomena as a process of ‘circular causality’ between moment-to-moment experiences on the ‘micro-level’(i.e, feelings, thoughts, or actual events influencing self-esteem), state self-esteem at the ‘meso-level’ (transient levels throughout the day), and trait self-esteem at the ‘macro-level’ (higher-order patterns). Stability (or maintenance) and adaptability (or flexibility) of self-esteem is considered the result of the dynamic interactions between processes of ‘bottom-up’ emergence (i.e, from micro to macro; trait self-esteem emerging from iterations of state self-esteem) and ‘top-down’ constraint (i.e, from macro to micro; trait self-esteem constrains current and future iterations of state self-esteem); the roles of self-amplifying and self-stabilizing feedback loops in mediating these processes has been previously described[178,179]. In this sense, iterations of state self-esteem and macro-level patterns of trait self-esteem mutually constrain and give rise to each other over nested time scales. 

Processes of bottom-up emergence can be studied from the micro- to meso-level (momentary self-related experiences to state-self esteem) of self-esteem, or from the meso- to macro-level (state self-esteem to trait self-esteem)[178]. The patterns of trait self-esteem that emerge from these nested processes can be conceptualized as ‘attractor’ or ‘repeller’ states; ‘attractors’ refers to the notion that a system is attracted to (usually multiple) stable states because a minimal amount of energy is needed to maintain that given pattern, whereas ‘repellors’ are unstable states that occur infrequently and/or very short durations[95-99,103,124,187,188].  From a top-down perspective, the nature of these attractors and repellers (i.e, their strength and valence) is considered to constrain the trajectories of state self-esteem at the micro- and meso-level[99,178]. State self-esteem is considered an intrinsically dynamic process that can be empirically evaluated either at the meso-level (via daily self-reports over months)[65-67,173-175,184-186] or at the micro-level as self-related experiences (via moment-to-moment thoughts, feelings, or behaviors in response to a specific context)[178-183]. Studies that collected self-report measures of state self-esteem multiple times a day from healthy adults reported that long-term dependencies in self-esteem time series could be observed as auto-correlated fractal patterns[184-186]. Fractal patterning of state self-esteem fluctuations has also been reported in students that described themselves for 3 minutes using the Mouse Paradigm[182,183], which is used to measure the intrinsic dynamics of moment-to-moment state self-esteem[97,187]. One of these studies revealed that individuals with higher self-concept clarity had more positive self-esteem attractors and weaker repellers, whereas people with lower clarity had stronger repellers and less positive attractors[183]. In parent-child dyadic interactions, it was determined that the temporal structure of real-time fluctuation of self-esteem exhibited pink noise and was only weakly correlated to the magnitude of variability of state self-esteem[180,181]. This goal of this proposed study is not to focus on the real-time self-organization between the micro-level (real-time fleeting experiences) and meso-level (state) of self-esteem, but rather the developmental self-organization between the iterative patterns of state self-esteem (meso-level) and the long-term nature of trait self-esteem (macro-level). Specifically, it will explore how trait self-esteem emerges from bottom-up processes in adolescents, as well as how the strength and stability of trait self-esteem attractor landscapes constrain daily fluctuations in state level self-esteem.

As children with ASD develop, they encounter greater social expectations to conform to their surroundings and become increasingly aware of their social difficulties, thereby leading to more stress and anxiety[5-11,48-54,75-85]. Social anxiety is considered to play a critical role in mediating the reciprocal relationships between emotional processing, communication skills, self-esteem, and psychosocial functioning[48-54,68-87,189-192] - all of which are reported to be impaired or negatively affected in individuals with ASD[5-11,13,30-36,68-70,75-84]. Given the importance of these relationships and the prevalence of social anxiety in autistic populations[34,46-54,77-87], specific scales for social anxiety[193-196] are frequently used to provide an estimate of how social stressors affect children or adolescents. Assessment techniques for generalized and social anxiety typically rely on retrospective surveys that ask individuals to estimate their anxiety levels based on recall of the past week(s) or month, thereby reflecting measures of trait anxiety (i.e, one’s proneness to a relatively stable level of anxiety, either generally or in a specific context)[189,193-200]. On the other hand, state anxiety is described as the momentary anxiety accompanied by physiological arousal in response to a stressor[197-200]. State anxiety is considered to be mediated by age, individual cognitive-behavioral factors, the type of extrinsic stimuli applied, and method of measurement[190-192,200-208]. Trait and state anxiety are related but separate constructs, and the differences between the two are fundamentally characterized by the method of assessment and the time scale examined[198-200]. Whereas high trait anxiety is related to higher state anxiety during interpersonal stress tasks in regular individuals[189,190,201,202], subjects with ASD and/or anxiety disorders often demonstrate either no correlation or an inverse correlation between trait and state anxiety (self-report or physiological surrogate measure)[83,203-208]. Inconsistencies in the reported relationships between state and trait anxiety are partially attributable to individual factors such as baseline levels of anxiety, negative self-cognitions, and difficulties in identifying or describing emotions[76,87,106,189-191,200-208]. However, it is also likely that the stability, adaptability, and intrinsic dynamics of emotions are of central importance for mediating how individuals respond to different environmental contexts[209,210]. 

Research on emotion dynamics in adults and adolescents thus far has primarily focused on the frequency, intensity, variability (range of fluctuations), stability (size of fluctuations), inertia (temporal dependency), and complexity of emotional states such as anxiety or depression[201-226]. Studies of state level changes in anxiety have mostly examined the (short-term) dynamic patterning or complexity of the physiological arousal in response to stress[201-208]. Increases in state anxiety in response to exam stress have been associated with significant decreases in the complexity of heart rate variability among individuals with high emotional reactivity[207], while another study observing adolescents during a regular school period of 2.5 hours found that those with high levels of anxiety had less complex (more predictable) heart rate time series[208]. In longer-term studies, individuals with rapid cycling bipolar disorder demonstrated more variable instability of daily emotional states than controls, but this affective instability was substantially more structured (less complex)[211,212]. Another study that collected data on daily affect and self-esteem over two weeks observed that adults with social anxiety exhibited greater instability of negative affect and self-esteem, as well as difficulties in emotional self-regulation (i.e, maintaining positive states and improving negative states)[213]. These authors suggested that individuals with social anxiety who were more likely to experience acute shifts in intense negative affect may be led to view experiences of anxiety as uncontrollable or threatening, and therefore attempt to avoid or suppress expression of these emotions. Individuals with low self-esteem and a greater fear of negative evaluation have also reported higher levels of threat emotions (i.e, anxiety) and emotional inertia in everyday life than better-adjusted peers, but with more substantial drops in inertia (greater reactivity) when anticipating a social stressor[214]. Use of ineffective emotional regulation strategies (i.e, suppression of negative feelings) in these populations is suggested to be followed by a ‘rebound effect’ that may maintain and/or exacerbate distress, and that can manifest as disproportionate reactivity to contextual disturbances[213-217]. Importantly, individuals who report more frequent, variable, and intense negative emotions (i.e, nervousness, anger, sadness) are more susceptible to the development of anxious or depressed mood episodes[217,218]; highly variable, unstable, and inert emotions have also been found to co-occur with worse psychological well-being[219]. 

While an overly flexible and excessively variable emotional response to contextual disturbances (especially negative life events) may be maladaptive, so might dynamical emotional patterns that are rigid and do not allow for flexible adaptability in response to stress (i.e, do not easily regulate emotions back to a positive state)[217-221]. Psychological flexibility is broadly reflected in how individuals are able to shift perspectives, appropriately regulate emotions and behaviors, or adapt to changing situational contexts over different time scales[220,221]. Early adolescence (transition from primary to middle school) is often characterized by highly variable and unstable emotion dynamics, as well as frequent sudden changes in levels of anxiety and depression[222-226]. These frequent, drastic changes in emotional states are representative of an increasingly unstable system that is situated in a rapidly changing environmental context, and is particularly vulnerable to sudden transitions following a minor perturbation[210,223,227]. The flexibility and degree to which individuals adapt to (or cope with) changes or environmental disturbances in everyday contexts over the course of adolescence is likely to shape these same patterns of emotional reactivity/regulation at greater time scales [103,209,223-226]. Recently, anxiety has been conceptualized as a self-organizing process that consists of interactions between transient, unpleasant emotional experiences at the micro-level, anxious episodic moods at the meso-level, and trait anxiety at the macro-level[209]. According to this conceptualization, trait level measures of anxiety can be represented by ‘attractor basins’ (or states of dynamic equilibria) situated within an ‘attractor landscape’ that act to constrain the real-time, subjective emotional states of anxiety. These depth of these emotional attractor basins represents the stability of a system in response to environmental disturbances; if the system is unstable at a given state, a large enough perturbation (or accumulation of smaller disturbances) may push the system over a tipping point towards another attractor[210,227]. In response to life events, rapid fluctuations in emotion/mood at the micro- and meso-level give rise to changes in the attractor landscape (i.e, strengthening or deepening attractors, adding or removing new attractor states), eventually returning the system to a stable state[209]. Thus far, no data is able to adequately represent this developmental process with respect to anxiety over the course of adolescence, despite the fact that phase of development is characterized by substantial variability in intra- and inter-personal frequency, intensity, and stability of emotional fluctuations[222-226]. There remains a need to elucidate how temporal structuring of state anxiety contributes to the developmental trajectories of trait level general and social anxiety, in addition to understanding its role in the emergence of variable self-esteem, impaired social functioning, and psychological dysfunction in autistic individuals. Explaining how and why daily fluctuations in state anxiety may influence the nature and development of trait level general and social anxiety is therefore another primary area of interest in this study. 

It is accepted that reciprocal relationships exist between self-esteem, psychological wellbeing, anxiety, and social competence (i.e, communication and social skills) that influence each other at different time-scales[5-13,35-38,56-85,89-99,123,189-192], and that the relevance of these variables compounds over development due to the increasing importance and complexity of age-related contextual changes[5-10,89-106,120-115,222-226]. Performance and achievement in social contexts are particularly relevant aspects for the formation of adolescents' self-esteem[56-62,72-74,89-94,103,175], and self-esteem in young people with ASD has been linked to how they perceive that others view them[5-13,46,70]. Adolescents with low self-esteem are likely to have a negative appraisal of themselves within social contexts[5-11,13,68-71,90-94,103], and negative interpretation biases and cognitions have been found to mediate social anxiety and state anxiety levels in response to challenging social situations[106,189-191,214]. Moreover, self-esteem and anxiety are considered to be inherently variable, dynamically fluid, and contextually embedded into the environment[59-67,95-99,103,209]. The stability and temporal structure of variability in self-esteem has been linked to individuals’ sensitivity to social feedback, psychological functioning, hostility, feelings of autonomy and competence, and levels of anxiety in social contexts[8-13,58-78,93,94,181-183,213,214], all of which are likely to influence how individuals respond in a collaborative setting. 

Autistic adolescents with low self-esteem and high levels of social anxiety may be more likely to withdraw from and avoid social interactions with peers[5-9,34-39,46-49,78-84,103-106]. Furthermore, individuals with ASD characteristically exhibit a rigid attitude towards the impact of interpersonal problems, an aversion to change away from repetitive behaviors (insistence on sameness), and intolerance to uncertainty[27-33] - all of which may meditate mechanisms of anxiety in this population[33,200]. Given this tendency toward cognitive-behavioral rigidity, one might expect not only that autistic adolescents display lower levels of self-esteem and higher (general and social) anxiety, but that fluctuations in these characteristics are also more rigid at both a micro- and macro-scale of observation. Also, by limiting their own opportunities for social interaction and practice of social skills, it is plausible that increasingly inflexible and avoidant behaviors would be observed over time. This might manifest as difficulty switching between behavioral modes in a dyadic interaction setting, and preferring individual work over collaborative work. In this study, the main aims are to investigate how typically-developing and autistic adolescents evolve with respect to (1) the organized, dynamic nature of their state self-esteem and anxiety, (2) how temporal structuring at the state level influences the development of trait or ‘baseline’ properties of these variables, and (3) whether the nature and developmental trajectories of these state/trait measures (at the intra- and inter- individual level) is reflected in the patterns of dyadic interaction in a cooperative problem-solving context.

## Methods 

Traditionally, research consists of measuring functional relations between static variables and modeling said change by assuming that observed relations represent causal mechanisms. Time is considered a causal or independent variable, assumptions of homogeneity and stationarity are made, and variability is treated as background ‘noise’. In this approach, inter-individual relations between variables are considered to reflect intra-individual relations, and inter-individual relations between variables remain constant over time[228,229]. However, correlations between variables as examined in inter-individual (group) approaches do not necessarily reflect a causal relationship. Changes within or across systems under study are not perfectly predictable; observations can vary based on the level or method of measurement, different contexts, and as functions of previous states. Moreover, development fundamentally reflects the notion of ‘process’ - or change over time - no matter the behavior or natural system under scrutiny. Treating human behavior as a complex dynamic system (CDS) acknowledges the non-linear, dynamic, and emergent nature of cognition and behavior by focusing on patterns of change over time at an individual level of analysis. From a CDS perspective, time is not treated as a causal variable, but as a background parameter that is used to observe patterns as they emerge from reciprocal interactions between system components at various levels and scales of analysis. This emphasis on self-organization and interaction-dominance (as opposed to component-dominance) has motivated researchers to change the way they approach behavioral time-series data[229,230]. By applying techniques such as fractal scaling or recurrence quantification analysis to study the structure of cognitive/social/behavioral data, insights can be revealed about the underlying mechanisms of how a given system develops, specifically how and why certain variables change as a function of their emergent properties and dynamic interactions[229-231].

Variability itself is simply a measure of dispersion away from a central tendency score, and is generally considered to be random noise in traditional research approaches. However, it is increasingly suggested that there is valuable information about the structure of cognitive-behavioral systems represented in this ‘noise’[230,232,233]. The variability that is observed in time-series of human behavior is often structured in a fractal or self-similar way, which is considered to result from self-organization and coordination between interacting processes at different levels and time scales (i.e, micro-, meso-, macro-scales)[228,229,231-235]. Emergence of self-organizing behavior from the interactions between fluctuating nested scales of a system is also reflected in the patterned changes in behavior over time that, upon reaching a given critical value, will result in sudden transitions to a different qualitative state (or phase) of the system. These ‘phase transitions’ can be modeled in phase space - or a set of all possible states of a dynamical system - in which attractors and repels define the stable and unstable values of a system, respectively[127-129,187,188,236]. Attractors are high-probability states or patterns toward which a system tends to gravitate; whereas repellors are unstable values that do not occur frequently or for long durations[183,187,188,236]. Quantifying the dynamics of these attractors and repellers is an approach to identifying how systems change as a function of current or past states (intrinsic dynamics), respond to ‘external’ perturbations (extrinsic dynamics), and display self-organizing behavior at different time scales. Defining cognitive-behavioral change in this way has been applied to the study of mood, anxiety, self-esteem, and typical developmental processes over the lifespan[95-101,103,207-212,217-226]. With respect to interpersonal communication, attractor states refer to the stable states that recur as a result of patterned interactions between coupled individuals[103,129,156,159,236]. Stability and complexity of coupled systems, as well as the strength of their (un)stable states, can be quantified using approaches that consider the temporal dependency of measured variability[124-133].

Measures of complexity, stability, and determinism derived from time series using fractal scaling and recurrence analysis allows for an understanding of not only how the dynamics of a system evolve at a all possible observed time scales, but how reciprocal interactions between macro-, meso, and micro-levels of the system give rise to new or different attractors. Fractal analysis techniques such as detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) allow for the quantification of the similarity of a structure at different scales of observation. Fractal time-series contain nested patterns of fluctuations and variability across scales of measurement; this patterning can be characterized as an inverse proportional relationship between the size/degree of a change and the frequency of similarly sized changes occurring. A power law is used to characterize the scaling relationship (how a measure depends upon the resolution that used to measure it) of a given variable, providing insight into the patterned structure of behavioral change over time[228,230-235]. Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) allows for further study of non-linear data by characterizing the nature and stability of recurrent (or attractor) states in a dynamic system[237,238]. A further refined version of this technique - cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA)[130-133,239-241] - allows for the quantification of the complex dynamics between coupled systems. Using this method to understand recurrences between two coupled behavioral systems provides insight into the stability and strength of recurring states that emerge from the coupled dynamics of the systems under study. It has been used to study the matching of cognitive and behavioral states in parent-child dyads [134-137], interpersonal synchrony and complementarity[140-145,147-150], and coordination among children and adolescents[138,139,151-156]. The relevance of using a CDS approach to understanding psychosocial and behavioral development throughout the lifespan has been extensively emphasized and reviewed[103,177,209,223].

Random fluctuations (white noise) of a time series produce a flat horizontal line in a log-log plot of power and frequency, whereas pink noise (1/f) is visualized by a diagonal line with a slope of -1 on the same plot.  A trademark of healthy, adaptive systems is the presence of pink noise, which has been identified in the temporal structuring of a wide variety of biological and cognitive-behavioral variables[232-235]. Shifts away from pink noise and toward white (disorder) or Brownian (ordered) noise have been observed in performance of higher complexity tasks, as a result of aging, neurodevelopmental disorders, and various diseases[207-212,232-234,242-246]. Of relevance to this study, the temporal structure of fluctuating variables such as self-esteem, state anxiety, and affect has been found to repeat itself, albeit not perfectly, at different scales of observation[178-187,207-212]. As individuals with psychological and behavioral disorders typically present with more variability in measures of mood, anxiety, and self esteem, but also more structure in this noise[97,103,207-212], it is anticipated that adolescents with ASD will exhibit changes in state anxiety and self-esteem that are more rigidly structured and predictable than TD peers. How temporal structuring of these state variables reciprocally influence ‘stable’ trait measures of social anxiety, overall anxiety, and self-esteem over a critical phase of development will be examined in this study. Fluctuations of self-esteem and anxiety at different time scales are likely to influence how individuals choose to interact in social scenarios[103,176-181,209,220]. Recent applications of CRQA for the study of dyadic interactions in a cooperative context are of particular relevance for this study[153-156]. Specifically, this study will employ a paradigm similar to that of Guevara et al (2017) to gain a deeper understanding of how interpersonal interaction preferences between autistic peers might differ from interactions between TD counterparts. The relative stability, frequency, and duration of collaborative and independent behavioral states (attractors) during a cooperative problem-solving task (tangram puzzle building) will be examined using CRQA, thereby quantifying the complexity and strength of these attractors at a micro-level of the system.

### Data Collection

A sample of around 20 adolescents (9-10 years old) from public schools that do not separate students with special needs or diagnosed developmental disabilities will be recruited. There should be an equal number of TD children (with no diagnosed cognitive or behavioral problems) and children diagnosed with ASD by a clinical psychologist. Several daily and intermittent measures are collected throughout the course of this study to determine how short- and long-term fluctuations of self-esteem and anxiety influence trait level changes in these variables, as well as dyadic interactions in adolescents with and without ASD. Individuals constituting the dyads for the problem-solving task are paired according to competence in the tangram task (later described) and with members of their own group (ASD-ASD or TD-TD). Two weeks prior to the start of the study, participants will come in and perform the 15-minute tangram task individually to attain a baseline measure of individual performance which will serve to match participants by skill level.

Trait self-esteem is measured in all participants using Rosenberg’s (1965) 10-item scale (RSE), which is found to be reliable and valid[247,248], and has been previously used with autistic adolescents[11,46,76]. Each item is either a positive (e.g. “I feel that I have a number of good qualities”) or a negative statement (e.g. “At times I think I am no good at all”) that participants respond to by indicating the degree to which they agree with the statement. State self-esteem is evaluated by the 20-item State Self-Esteem scale (SSES)[173] that is considered to be reliable, valid, and appropriate for adolescent populations[174,175]. The scale measures how individuals currently feel about their performance, appearance, and social self; it consists of positive or negative statements such as “ I feel good about myself” and “I feel inferior to others at this moment”. Responses for both of these scales are originally measured on a 4-point Likert scale, but they can also be obtained on a visual analog scale ranging from 0 - 10 to potentially allow for better expression of variability in the assessment[184-186]. 

Social anxiety is measured using the Social Anxiety Scale for Children-revised[193,194], which is a reliable and valid 18-item self-report questionnaire for TD and autistic youth[79-81,84,193-196]. The scale includes questions about subjective thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioral manifestations of social anxiety (i.e, avoidance, distress). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale and summed across to obtain total scores and individual subscale scores. State and trait anxiety are measured using the both forms of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAI-C)[198], which is adapted from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory[197]. The trait subscale evaluates how anxious individuals generally feel, while the state subscale evaluates the transient level of anxiety with question items that ask about their current feelings of apprehension, tension, nervousness, and worry. Each subscale consists of 20 items, which are traditionally measured on a 4-point Likert scale (higher scores representing higher anxiety), however these questions can also be reformulated to correspond to a visual analog scale ranging from 0 - 10 to allow for better expression by the participants. Both subscales of the STAI-C are considered reliable and valid in children and adolescents[189,190,196,198-200].

Trait self-esteem, trait anxiety, and social anxiety are to be assessed at four separate time points, separated by four months. These questionnaires are to be conducted in person, on the days in which participants are observed during the dyadic problem-solving task. State self-esteem (20 items) and state level anxiety (10 question items) will be assessed using a combined questionnaire on mobile devices or laptop computers twice a day for 512 days, starting at the beginning of the school year (typically end of August). The first assessment takes place within two hours of walking up, prior to school (on weekdays), or between 6:00 and 8:00. The second assessment is ideally performed 12 hours after the first to ensure a relatively constant time interval. Reminder notifications to complete the questionnaire on the mobile application/software can be sent 30 minutes of one hour prior to each assessment to ensure that participants will provide complete time-series. The combined items of the self-esteem and anxiety assessment can be presented successively in random order, and participants can select responses on the visual analog scale (i.e, response ranges from 0 = "not at all" and 10 = "absolutely"). In total, the questionnaire should take no more than 5-10 minutes to complete and submit. Data from each participant will be recorded as two time-series with 1024 points for both the self-esteem and anxiety dimensions. 

Dyadic interaction is assessed during an interactive tangram game on a touch-screen interface similar to what has been described in recent studies with autistic individuals[160-166]. Tangram puzzles require players to assemble 7 two-dimensional shapes into a pattern outlined on the screen; using a touch-screen format, they can touch the shapes and drag them into the correct locations. Pairs of children are seated next to each other and have 15 minutes to complete as many digital tangram puzzles as possible on a single tablet. The puzzles appearing on the screen are relatively difficult for each child; if puzzles are being solved very quickly (within 20-30 seconds), or only one participant is actively engaging, the difficulty of the puzzles presented will be increased so that participants are more incentivized to collaborate Once a puzzle is completed by the pair, it does not reappear in the series on the screen in any of the following sessions. Participants are told that they are allowed to speak and communicate with each other freely, and that they will be scored based on how many total puzzles they solve. Task performance is assessed by the number of tangram puzzles solved by the dyad. After providing instructions, the test administrator leaves the room, and performance of the tangram task is video recorded so that coding of interactive behavior can take place without observational interference. 

Categories of interaction behaviors are coded similar to a previous study[156]: 1=no engagement with task (i.e, highly distracted and unengaged); 2=passive work (i.e, staring at or contemplating problem on the screen without attempting to move around puzzle pieces); 3=imitative work (i.e, distracted or unrelated conversation with partner without considering task); 4=parallel work (i.e, actively working alone, moving puzzle pieces without consideration of partner); and 5=collaborative work (i.e, active engagement with task and partner, discussing parts that they are struggling with, asking questions, taking turns). If consensus is reached collaboratively about a specific puzzle and the child then completes the tangram independently, this action is still coded as collaborative work. On the other hand, parallel work is coded if a child proceeds with or finishes a puzzle without engaging with the other dyad participant at all. Interactions are coded second-by-second for four sessions of data collection, each session separated by approximately four months. Individual time-series are obtained for each child of the dyad for every session. The pairs of children constituting the dyads work with the same partner for every testing session.

### Fractal Scaling

Time series data for self-reported state self-esteem and anxiety will be subjected to fractal scaling analysis to examine long-range dependencies and scaling relations in these variables. First, the scores for state self-esteem and anxiety are summed for each instance that the questionnaire is completed (positively phrased questions for each measure will be subtracted from the total scores), resulting in two total measures of state self-esteem and anxiety for every day. For every participant, 1024 data points will be collected for both measures and analyzed separately. The Rstudio package ‘dfa’ can be used to perform detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) on each recorded time series. This technique reveals long-range correlations in the data by quantifying the scaling relation between window sizes of data and the standardized errors of the windowed data[249]. Time-series data for each participant is integrated, divided into non-overlapping bins of equal length, detrended, and processed by subtracting the local trend and calculating the root mean square (fluctuation) for each bin. This process is then repeated over increasing window sizes for both data sets (state self-esteem and state anxiety) for each participant, and results are plotted on log-log scales. The slope that results from plotting the size of the fluctuations (variance) over increasing window sizes with the frequency of these fluctuations represents the scaling exponent[233,250]. 

In 1/f scaling, size of the fluctuations are proportional to window size and inversely proportional to the frequency of their occurrence: this is represented by a linear relationship on the log-log scale (slope=1)[233,250]. White noise would have a slope of 0.5, representing an uncorrelated signal. If the slope is greater than 0.5, the time series is said to show long-range correlations (approaching pink noise). From the slope, the fractal dimension (FD) can be directly calculated using a previously described method[251]. Natural pink noise corresponds to an FD around 1.2, whereas an FD < 1.2 or FD ≈ 1.5 would imply the presence of Brownian motion (brown noise) or white noise, respectively[233]. The shuffled slopes method can finally be applied to determine if the underlying structure of the time series for each variable significantly deviates from the null hypothesis from white noise[230,233]. When a time series is randomized after data points are recorded, the mean and standard deviation may remain the same, but the temporal structure is gone. By performing DFA on the original and shuffled time series for both self-esteem and anxiety, it can be determined whether the underlying structure is truly non-random.

### Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis

For coupled systems, a cross-recurrence plot (CRP) identifies when the systems revisit shared/recurrent behaviors and visualizes the temporal organization of the interactions between systems[130-133,239-241]. Each dot in the CRP represents a moment where a behavioral state of the one partner is matched in a specific way by that of the other. Different types of categorical behavioral matches between two coupled behavioral systems can then be color coded and visualized simultaneously[133]. The dynamic structure of the interactions between these systems can then be quantified using CRQA. First, the five interaction categories recorded from the video-analysis (1 = no work; 2 = passive; 3 = imitative; 4 = parallel; 5 = collaborative) will be matched according to the behavior of each member of the dyad (person 1 = P1; person 2 = P2). These three interaction states are: collaborative work (CW; both P1 and P2 = 5), independent work (IW; P1 and/or P2 = 4), and no work (NW; all other categorical combinations). Only one combination of interaction states is possible for CW (labeled blue), or 4% (1 of 25) of total state space possibilities, as both members of the dyad must be actively engaging with each other in this behavioral coding. On the other hand, IW consists of seven possible combinations (labeled red), or 28% (7 of 25) of total state space possibilities. Although parallel or individual work on the task still suggests that at least one child is contributing to solving the tangram puzzles and increasing the total score, collaborative work was specifically defined by the dyad participants engaging with each other to progress further with the task. The relevant outcomes for this study are primarily focused on collaborative vs independent working behaviors during a problem-solving task in which collaboration is encouraged, but not enforced, as a condition for success. This is why collaborative work is considered a separate category to individual work, rather than differentiating between ‘distributed dyadic interactions’ or ‘unequal dyadic interactions’ as other authors have previously done[156]. 

For this study, CRQA  is employed to compare the behaviors of the participants at each individual time point and at all possible delays between the individual behaviors of the interacting dyad. Outcomes provide information about the coupling and stability of adolescents’ behaviors at a specific moment, as well as throughout the rest of the interaction. Details regarding the data processing, matching behaviors in the matrix ‘rec’, and performance of CRQA in the R package ‘crqa’ can be found in previous papers[130,252]. Prior to performing CRQA, recurrence parameters are set based on previously reported procedures [130,133]. The embedding dimension - typically found by employing Falsest Nearest Neighbor Analysis[253,254] - represents the minimal amount of dimensions needed to model the system. The optimal embedding lag can be found using the least mutual information method[255], at which point in the time series a maximal amount of new information can be gained about the temporal structure of the data. Setting the embedding dimension = 1 and delay = 1 for categorical CRQA is appropriate, and the radius - which determines the precision of measuring recurrent behavior - will be set to 0 as analyses will be run on categorical time series in which recurrent dyadic behaviors are perfectly matched[133]. Once parameters are set, the categorical data can be imported into the appropriate workspace in Rstudio and the CRQA script is run[130]. The recurrence outcomes of each behavioral category for each dyadic interaction will be recorded and used for further statistical analyses/comparisons. The shuffled slopes method can then be applied to determine if the underlying structure of the time series for each dyad partner deviate from the null hypothesis that there is no structure in the variation over time[132]. By comparing CRQA measures from the original and shuffled time series for both self-esteem and anxiety, it can be determined whether the underlying structure is truly non-random. 

The relevant outcomes described below are calculated as overall measures and separately for each color[130-133,237-240]. Outcome measures are also calculated for the shuffled time series and are compared in order to determine if they vary significantly at each of the four time points, and if the changes over the measurement periods are also significant. Recurrence rate (RR or REC) represents the proportion of recurrent states between the coupled time series, and it is a measure of the degree to which the two behavioral states are confined to a similar/same phase space. The overall RR quantifies the global level of coordination between the individuals over all time points (RR_O), relative RR is the level of coordination for a given color or matching behavior (RR_B and RR_R for blue and red, respectively), and RR on the diagonal (line of synchrony; RR_LOS) quantifies the proportion of a matching behavior being performed by the coupling dyad at the same point in time. Entropy of vertical lines (ENTVL) represents the complexity of an attractor state resulting from the coupled activity of the dyad; it is a measure of the disorder in the distribution of the vertical line lengths observed in the CRP. The higher this measure, the higher the complexity of the dyadic interaction[256]. The longest sequence of recurrent states (or the longest vertical line the recurrence plot) is represented by the Max Vertical Line (MAXVL) measure, which provides a proportional measure of the stability or strength of a particular attractor state resulting from the coordination between the two participants. Laminarity (LAM) and trapping time (TT) are measures that broadly reflect the flexibility or rigidity of the coupled behaviors; LAM is the proportion of recurrent points that consist of vertical line structures and TT is the average length of these structures. Specifically, TT represents how long the systems stay in a particular behavior or attractor state (in this case CW or IW), and LAM represents how frequently the systems revisit a shared state.

## Discussion and Expected Outcomes

This research proposal focuses on adolescents with and without ASD, as adolescence is considered a critical period for development of self-esteem and psychological functioning[56,68-71,81,89-106,209,221-226]. Self-esteem and anxiety are considered to contribute to interpersonal functioning and communication skills at several levels of analysis (i.e, their amount, variability, stability, complexity, etc), which in turn have a reciprocal impact on cognitive-behavioral states throughout development[5-13,56-72,88-106,123,177-181,187,200-209]. The self-organizing nature of self-esteem (as a transient experience/state/trait) and anxiety (as an emotion/mood/personality trait) has previously been modeled to explain the emergence of these phenomena from interactions between the systems’ intrinsic and extrinsic dynamics at different time scales[95-101,103,178-181,209,217,221,223]. Importantly, peer interactions are a key aspect for the development of self-esteem, social competence, and attitudes towards interpersonal relationships over adolescence, which in turn serve to define how individuals behave and experience future social contexts[8-13,68-71,88-106,123,177]. Social competence and peer relations also play a critical role in the emergence of general and social anxiety during adolescence[6,46-48,78-85,103-106,189,200]. Importantly, school-children with ASD often struggle more in cooperative situations than TD peers and prefer to play or engage with tasks independently instead of engaging with peers[5-11,14-26,34-37,103,137-139,177]. These individuals also characteristically exhibit cognitive-behavioral inflexibility  that broadly manifests as insistence on sameness and/or intolerance to uncertainty - factors which are interrelated and intimately linked to anxiety, social motivation, and social skills in this population[27-34,172,189,200]. Poor social skills and withdrawal from social settings limits opportunities for development of interpersonal skills, thereby promoting a cycle of social anxiety, avoidance, and impaired social competence[5-13,34-37,46-54,68-94,103-106,123,209]. As effective cooperation with peers is emphasized as an important component of successful cognitive-behavioral, social, and academic development[21-26,103,106-123], it is important to understand the emergence of differences in the quality of interpersonal interactions between TD and autistic adolescents.

Interpersonal behaviors are shaped by the perceptions, capabilities, cognitive-behavioral states of individuals involved, and the contextual constraints of the environment in which participants are situated - all of which are dynamically and synergistically interacting with each other over time[103,124-129,159,177]. Although no studies thus far have specifically examined the relationships between the state-level developmental trajectories in self-esteem/anxiety and how adolescents interact in collaborative settings, hypotheses can be drawn from literature which combines some of these aspects separately. Individual and group level (ASD vs TD) analyses will be performed for several variables at different time scales to better understand how these processes might reciprocally influence each other. Hypotheses are explored regarding (1) the temporal structure of state self-esteem and anxiety, (2) the influence of state-level patterns on developmental trajectories of trait-level self-esteem and general/social anxiety, and (3) how autistic and TD adolescents interact with like-peers in a dyadic collaborative problem-solving context. This study also aims to understand (4) whether there are relationships between the intrinsic dynamics of state self-esteem/anxiety throughout adolescence and the patterns of behavioral coupling during a dyadic problem-solving task, as well as (5) whether differences in these interactions might be explained or mediated by macro-level levels or changes in self-esteem or social anxiety.

Low levels of self-esteem are common in children and adolescents with autism[7-9,13,68-70,75,76], and are predictive of behavioral problems independently of impaired emotion recognition[74]. Both trait and state self-esteem measures are predicted to remain relatively stable throughout the course of this study for TD participants, whereas decreases in mean values are expected in adolescents with ASD. Autistic adolescents also typically report higher levels of general anxiety, social anxiety, and behavioral avoidance than their TD peers[5-9,30-38,46-54,77-84,189,200,203-206]. Social anxiety has been shown to increase in children with ASD as they grow older, whereas social and general anxiety decreases in TD counterparts[84]. In this study, autistic adolescents are therefore expected to have higher mean levels of state and trait anxiety (general and social) at all time points compared to TD peers, and they are expected to show an increase or maintenance of these values over the course of the study as opposed to the predicted decrease in TD adolescents. Individuals with psychological and behavioral disorders often present with greater variability and instability of mood, anxiety, and self-esteem[58-67,81-84,99-104,200-214,217-226], but more structure (less complexity) in the fluctuations of these measures[207-212,223-226,233] - similar patterns are also expected in the sample of ASD adolescents in this study. Adolescents with ASD are anticipated to have higher levels of variability (standard deviations) in trait and state level measures of self-esteem and anxiety, whereas the temporal patterning of state self-esteem and anxiety fluctuations will be more rigid and structured in these individuals (approaching Brownian noise, or FD > 1.4). On the other hand, less variable but more flexible and complex patterning (approaching pink noise, or FD ≈ 1.2) might be observed in state self-esteem and anxiety time series of TD children. 

Long-term dependencies in state self-esteem time series have been observed as auto-correlated fractal patterns[99,178-186], and the temporal structuring of emotions such as anxiety is considered to shape the fluctuations of (and interactions between) future emotions, moods, and personality traits[103,209-214,217,221-226]. The stability of self-esteem and anxiety has also been found to be partially mediated by trait level measures of these variables[58-71,93-101,178-183,189-192,209,213,221-226]. In this study, a positive association is expected between the level of trait self-esteem and the flexibility/adaptability of state self-esteem (proximity of FD to pink noise). An interaction effect might be observed between changes in the mean values of trait self-esteem over the course of this study and the complexity of state self-esteem time series. That is, a greater decrease in trait self-esteem over the four measurement periods might be related to reduced complexity (inflexibility) of state-self-esteem. It is also hypothesized that higher levels of trait anxiety - both general and social - will also be associated with lower levels of complexity in the state anxiety time series (FD approaching Brownian noise). In autistic individuals, it is also likely that this relationship will be stronger for social anxiety than for general anxiety. Similar to the anticipated interaction effect for self-esteem, it is plausible that greater increases in trait anxiety (general and/or social) over the four measurement periods will be associated with higher variability and rigidity/inflexibility of state anxiety fluctuations. Furthermore, greater predictability of the state self-esteem series (i.e, less complex) is hypothesized to be associated with higher trait anxiety (general/social), and the proximity to pink noise of the state anxiety time series is predicted to be positively related to higher trait self-esteem. Social anxiety is considered to mediate the reciprocal relationships between emotional processing, communication skills, psychosocial functioning and self-esteem[6,46-54,77-87,103-106,189-192]. In turn, the level, variability, stability, and inertia of self-esteem has been associated with anxiety, hostility, social competence, and self-concept clarity[8-13,56-76,90-94,182,183]. It is accepted that autistic individuals have a reduced clarity of self-concept, likely mediated by difficulties in identifying and describing emotions, as well as deficits in theory of mind processes and executive function[11,19-24,36,86,87]. As these impairments can also impact the ability to accurately report anxiety, it has been suggested that state-level evaluations of anxiety and self-esteem may be more accurate in this population[200,204]. Therefore, it is probable that mean state levels of anxiety/self-esteem will correspond more strongly with trait level measures in TD individuals than in ASD counterparts. 

In another similar study[156], it was demonstrated that healthy adolescents were more strongly coordinated to distributed rather than  unequal dyadic interactions) and showed increasingly complex coupling behaviors over six sessions of task performance. Regarding the participants’ interactions in this study’s problem-solving task, it is expected that both recurrence measures (RR_O and RR_LOS) of CW will be higher than IW and NW for all dyads. Both RR_O and RR_LOS are not expected to change much over the four testing periods for the CW attractor state, whereas some decreases may be observed in these outcome measures for IW (particularly RR_LOS). The amount and direction of these changes in outcome measures for both coupled behavioral states (CW/IW), as well as the recurrence values themselves, are hypothesized to vary depending on the group (ASD-ASD or TD-TD). Adapting to unfamiliar social situations (particularly in goal-oriented contexts) requires some level of cognitive-behavioral flexibility[29,103,120-126,172,209,217-221], which is considered to be impaired in individuals with ASD and interfere with the success of social interactions[7,27-33,172,203,204]. Indeed, autism is often characterized by behavioral rigidity and inflexibility that can manifest as difficulties in switching strategies or behavioral modes in cooperative games, and reduced effort in re-engaging and cooperating with a partner once an interaction has ended[5-7,23-29]. Autistic children are also less likely to initiate or maintain interpersonal behaviors in social contexts than TD peers, and more inclined to play or work independently instead of engaging with peers[2-11,21-16,30-37,78-81]. It is therefore hypothesized that RR_O and RR_LOS outcome measures will be relatively higher for IW and lower for CW among ASD-ASD dyads than in TD-TD pairs, and that ASD-ASD dyads will exhibit higher values (and less change over time) of TT and MAXVL measures for all behavioral modes. In other words, individuals with ASD are hypothesized to (1) gravitate more strongly toward independent work and away from collaborative efforts, (2) be less flexible in switching between coupled behavioral states, and (3) be more likely to remain or dwell at a given attractor state for a longer period of time than their TD peers. Regarding the changes in outcome variables over the four sessions, it is hypothesized that MAXVL and TT will decrease, whereas ENTVL will increase. These changes reflect an increase in flexibility and complexity of the dyadic interactions, respectively, and are expected to be observed with respect to both relevant attractor states of coupled behavior (CW/IW) and in groups of dyads (ASD-ASD/TD-TD) - albeit to varying degrees. 

As participants in this study are not necessarily matched for sex or other factors that may influence performance (with the exception of individual task competence at baseline), differences in intra- and inter-dyadic task performances may only partially be attributed to interactive strategies. Nevertheless, it is expected that higher values of RR_O, RR_LOS, and ENTVL for the CW attractor, as well as lower values of TT and MAXVL for both CW and IW attractors will be correlated with better performance in the task (more puzzles solved) at all time points. That is, the level of performance in this task is hypothesized to be predicted by higher complexity, overall behavioral coupling, and coupling at the same time of CW behaviors - as well as greater flexibility of both IW and CW attractor states. Differences might also be observed between the dyads of ASD or TD adolescents with respect to how the complexity and stability of either attractor state relates to overall task performance. Over the four sessions of testing, it is expected that performance will either be maintained or improve for all dyads, but that the interaction patterns that correspond with changes in performance will differ between groups. Specifically, while RR_O or RR_LOS for both CW and IW states are not anticipated to change significantly for either ASD-ASD or TD-TD dyads, differences between groups are expected with respect to changes in the rigidity and complexity of the dyadic system over time. In the study by Guevara et al (2017), dyads of TD children demonstrated increases in ENTVL and decreases in TT and MAXVL for both distributed and unequal dyadic interactions over six training sessions. This shift towards increased complexity and flexibility of coupled behaviors over time was proposed to result from an adaptive response to increasing task difficulty[156]. As the difficulty of tangram puzzles is also projected to increase over the course of this study, similar patterns may be observed in the TD dyads; however, clear predictions cannot necessarily be drawn for dyads consisting of adolescents with ASD. It may be that adaptations in the nature and structure of interpersonal coordination in response to changing task constraints (such as feedback or difficulty) will vary in this population[156-158].

Finally, clear associations have also been previously established between self-esteem development trajectories, elevated levels of anxiety, and social competence[6-13,34-37,46-54,68-94,99-106,189,200-209]. Positive relationships have been reported between the level of self-esteem and the number and complexity of behavioral patterns in dyadic interaction situations[257]; higher state and trait levels of affect (i.e, anxiety) are also linked to reduced stability and flexibility at the physiological, behavioral, and social level[201-214,2017-226]. For this reason, lower mean levels of self-esteem and higher mean levels of trait anxiety (general and social) are anticipated to be inversely related to the strength, stability, and complexity of both attractor states. How these relationships might differ with respect to group (ASD-ASD/TD-TD), attractor states (CW/IW), or social vs general anxiety - in addition to whether an interaction effect exists between trait levels of self-esteem and anxiety - is unknown and needs to be investigated. Higher levels of variability and rigidity (lower complexity) in state self-esteem and anxiety time series are also hypothesized to be inversely associated to the strength, stability, and complexity of the CW attractor. Considering the strength, stability, and complexity of the IW attractor, it is possible that differences corresponding to the individuals’ trajectories of self-esteem and anxiety may be observed to varying degrees depending on the group or measurement time point. Indeed, the strength of these associations may also differ between the TD and ASD groups (especially over the four testing sessions) as adolescents with ASD are expected to experience declines in self-esteem and increases in anxiety over the course of development, whereas the opposite trend (or a leveling-off of these variables) is typically observed in TD children[11,78-85,89-94,103,177,189,200,209]. Moreover, predictions may be further confounded by the fact that this period of adolescence (9-12 years old) consists of significant changes/transitions in social, contextual, and physiological domains that correspond with elevated levels of variability and instability in self-esteem and anxiety[99-106,172,200,209,222-226].
