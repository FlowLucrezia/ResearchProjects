1. **Feedback Valence**
	- Positive vs Negative
	- Valenced vs Neutral
	... influence on extent of physiological synchrony
	- Positive valence --> greater synchrony than negative
	- Valenced --> greater synchrony than neutral
		- possible interaction effect or opposite effect depending on direction of valence

2. Trait Level **Empathy**
	- Team Level (aggregate)
		- Cognitive
		- Affective
	- Individual Level (abs difference, variance between teammates)
		- Cognitive
		- Affective
	... influence on extent of physiological synchrony
	- Greater aggregate empathy scores --> greater synchrony
	- Greater difference in empathy between teammates --> lower synchrony

3. Self-report **Rapport with human teammate**
	- Team Level (aggregate)
	- Individual Level (abs difference, variance between teammates)
	...to what extent is it predicted by the extent of physiological synchrony
	- Greater synchrony --> 
		- greater team-level rapport with human teammate
		- lower differences between teammates in rapport with human teammate
	... MODERATING EFFECT of:
	- aggregate empathy
		- greater team-level empathy -->
			- strengthen relationship between synchrony and team-level rapport
			- weaken relationship between synchrony and differences in rapport
	- individual-level empathy
		- greater differences in empathy scores between teammates -->
			- weaken relationship between synchrony and team-level rapport
			- strengthen relationship between synchrony and differences in rapport

4. Self-report **Rapport with AI teammate**
	- Team Level (aggregate)
	- Individual Level (abs difference, variance between teammates)
	...to what extent is it predicted by the extent of physiological synchrony
			... MODERATING EFFECT of AI feedback condition
	- Greater synchrony in the case of positive (vs negative) feedback -->
		- Greater team-level rapport with AI teammate
		- Less difference between teammates in rapport with AI teammate
			... consider divisiveness and competition as an explanation for effects of negative condition vs facilitation of cooperation and collaboration in positive condition
	- Greater synchrony in the case of valenced (vs neutral) feedback -->
		- Greater team-level rapport with AI teammate
		- Less difference between teammates in rapport with AI teammate
			... consider effects of enhancing engagement and interest in task with valenced condition, in turn influencing the cohesiveness between teammates in their rapport with the AI teammate, or their 'user experience'

Influence of **emotional valence of feedback** on:
- communication frequency and distribution among team members
- reciprocality of communication flow/exchange
	- Leader-Follower dynamics
	- Is symmetrical turn-taking behavior more or less conducive to team performance and positive perceptions of team behavior?
- changes in distribution of communicative influence 
	- over time course of task
	- in response to task-related perturbations
- physiological synchrony & entrainment
	- extent of synchrony
	- strength of attractor state
	- determinism/predictability of shared states
	- entropy/complexity of shared or recurring states
	- stability of shared states

Influence of **team role-structure** (behavioral constraints on task performance) on:
- communication frequency and distribution among team members
- reciprocality of communication flow/exchange
- changes in distribution of communicative influence 
	- over time course of task
	- in response to task-related perturbations
- physiological synchrony & entrainment
	- extent of synchrony
	- strength of attractor state
	- determinism/predictability of shared states
	- entropy/complexity of shared or recurring states

where team role-structure:
- mutable roles (all can control task performance and communicate with AI teammate)
- fixed roles (controller of task performance, guide communicates with AI teammate)
