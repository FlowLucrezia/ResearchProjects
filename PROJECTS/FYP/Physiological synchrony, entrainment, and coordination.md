## Synchronization
- Synchronization vs coupling vs linkage...
- How to conceptually frame synchronization...
	- trend synchrony
		- e.g., determining whether mothers and children tend to show a common linear (or quadratic, cubic, etc.) change in HR across an experimental task 
	- concurrent synchrony
		- e.g., identifying the degree of common, moment-to-moment physiology between partners
	- **lagged synchrony**
		- extent to which one partner’s physiology predicts the other’s future physiology (controlling for each partner’s own physiology at the previous time point)
- Methodological approaches for nonstationary, noisy data (i.e, physiological series like ECG, HR)
	- wavelet coherence
	- cross-wavelet
	- dynamic time warping
	- detrended cross-correlation
	- multiscale (lagged) regression analysis
	- windowed multiscale synchrony

## Cardiac Activity
- Autonomic NS
	- SNS vs PSNS distinction
- Polyvagal Theory **(e.g., see @sullivanYogaTherapyPolyvagal2018)**
	- sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
		> "Fight/flight behaviors require activation of the SNS and are the initial and primary defense strategies recruited by mammals. This defense strategy requires increased metabolic output to support mobilization behaviors. Within PVT the recruitment of SNS in defense follows the Jacksonian principle of dissolution and reflects the adaptive reactions of a phylogenetically ordered response hierarchically in which the VVC has failed to mitigate threat. When the SNS circuit is recruited there are massive physiological changes including an increase in muscle tone, shunting of blood from the periphery, inhibition of gastrointestinal function, a dilation of the bronchi, increases in heart rate and respiratory rate, and a release of catecholamines. This mobilization of physiological resources sets the stage for responding to real or assumed danger in the environment and towards the end-goals of safety and survival. When the SNS becomes the dominant neural platform, the VVC influence may be inhibited in favor of mobilizing resources for rapid action. Whereas prosocial behaviors and social connection are associated with the VVC, the SNS is associated with behaviors and emotions such as fear or anger that help to orient to the environment for protection or safety." 
	- dorsal vagal complex (DVC)
		> "arises from the dorsal nucleus of the vagus (DNX) and provides the primary vagal motor fibers to organs located below the diaphragm. This circuit is designed to adaptably respond to immense danger or terror and is the most primitive (i.e., evolutionarily oldest) response to stress. Activation of the DVC in defense results in a passive response characterized by decreased muscle tone, dramatic reduction of cardiac output to reserve metabolic resources, alteration in bowel and bladder function via reflexive defecation and urination to reduce metabolic demands required by digestion and other bodily processes. This inhibition of viscera reflects an attempt to reduce metabolic and oxygen demands to the least amount necessary for survival. Behaviorally this is often referred to as immobilization or shutdown associated with feigning death, behavioral shutdown, collapse, or “freeze” responses, and may be experienced in humans as a disembodied dissociative state that may include loss of consciousness."
	- ventral vagal complex (VVC)
		> "provides the neural structures that mediate the “social engagement system”. When safety is detected in the internal and external environment, the VVC provides a neural platform to support prosocial behavior and social connection by linking the neural regulation of visceral states supporting homeostasis and restoration to facial expressivity and the receptive and expressive domains of communication (e.g., prosodic vocalizations and enhanced ability to listen to voice). The motor component of the VVC, which originates in the nucleus ambiguus (NA), regulates and coordinates the muscles of the face and head with the bronchi and heart. These connections help orient the person towards human connection and engagement in prosocial interactions and provide more flexible and adaptive responses to environmental challenges including social interactions ([Porges, 2011](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00067/full#B54), [2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00067/full#B55); [Porges and Carter, 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00067/full#B56))."
