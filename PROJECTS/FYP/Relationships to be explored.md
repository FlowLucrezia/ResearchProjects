Influence of **emotional valence of feedback** on:
- communication frequency and distribution among team members
- reciprocality of communication flow/exchange
	- Leader-Follower dynamics
	- Is symmetrical turn-taking behavior more or less conducive to team performance and positive perceptions of team behavior?
- changes in distribution of communicative influence 
	- over time course of task
	- in response to task-related perturbations
- physiological synchrony & entrainment
	- extent of synchrony
	- strength of attractor state
	- determinism/predictability of shared states
	- entropy/complexity of shared or recurring states
	- stability of shared states

Influence of **team role-structure** (behavioral constraints on task performance) on:
- communication frequency and distribution among team members
- reciprocality of communication flow/exchange
- changes in distribution of communicative influence 
	- over time course of task
	- in response to task-related perturbations
- physiological synchrony & entrainment
	- extent of synchrony
	- strength of attractor state
	- determinism/predictability of shared states
	- entropy/complexity of shared or recurring states

where team role-structure:
- mutable roles (all can control task performance and communicate with AI teammate)
- fixed roles (controller of task performance, guide communicates with AI teammate)
