### TO DO

- Start obsidian file with notes
- Search terms for google scholar
- Plan lit review
- Start with ralf’s paper and model and jayci’s thesis
	- [[A Dynamic Model of Human Limb Selection]]
- Look at original turvey lit and dialogues
- ask nia to send -> Dynamics of human intersegmental coordination: Theory and research.
- Plug papers into notebook.lm or other lit review software to summarize findings and theoretical points…. Read through and annotate in obsidian

### Key points to consider in outline

- IMMEDIATE vs INTERMEDIATE time scale of learning
	- Link between the short- and long-term memory of the system...
	- What is readily available
- Generalizability of limb selection literature to the concept of limb dominance etc
- Interpretation of given experimental paradigm
	- circle drawing, tapping, reaching/pointing, pendulum swinging
	- voluntary vs frequency-induced spontaneous transitions
		- matching metronome or specific multifrequency pattern
		- spontaneous transitions due to increased frequency
	- response to mechanical or visual perturbations
	- speed vs accuracy constraints
		- assessment of performance as a tradeoff
			- accuracy within target movement time
			- how to assess movement time in a VALID manner
		- see @mcgrathReducedAsymmetryMotor2016 for overview of handedness asymmetry in motor skill learning (ID of observed effect, not necessarily theoretically useful)
		- instructions!
	- frequency vs amplitude constraints
- EXTENT of laterality/handedness
- Laterality, attention, movement parameters... impact on:
	- memory & associated tuning of coupling parameters that influence -
	- changes in attractor landscape (possible solution space, intermediate time scale) 
	- selection of solution/stability of attractor (action selection, convergent solution, immediate time scale)
- handedness in context of visuo-motor adaptation and inter-segmental dynamics
	- interaction vs muscle torque (proxy for neural activation)
		- see @sainburgEvidenceDynamicdominanceHypothesis2002
	- pursuit rotor test to assess motor skill learning/adaptation
		- see @choHandednessAsymmetryMotor2006
- Link between changes in amplitude of attended limb, the uncoupled frequency of that limb, and the phase relation between limbs -> observed lead-lag relationship
- Translation to more generalizable and complex coordination processes
	- see @giovaniniDoesGamePressure2020
	- Running, walking, wheelchair propulsion
- Intra-individual rhythmic → inter-individual rhythmic

### Papers to find
