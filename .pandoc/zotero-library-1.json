[{"id":"abduDemonstratingMathematicsLearning2023","abstract":"This paper combines recent developments in theories of knowledge (complex dynamic systems), technologies (embodied interactions), and research tools (multimodal data collection and analysis) to offer new insights into how conceptual mathematical understanding can emerge. A complex dynamic system view models mathematics learning in terms of a multimodal agent who encounters a set of task constraints. The learning process in this context includes destabilizing a systemic configuration (for example, coordination of eye and hand movements) and forming new dynamic stability adapted to the task constraints. To test this model empirically, we applied a method developed to study complex systems, recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), to investigate students’ eye–hand dynamics during a touchscreen mathematics activity for the concept of proportionality. We found that across participants (n = 32), fluently coordinated hand-movement solutions coincided with more stable and predictable gaze patterns. We present a case study of a prototypical participant’s hand–eye RQA and audio–video data to show how the student’s cognitive system transitioned out of prior coordination reflective of additive thinking into a new coordination that can ground multiplicative thinking. These findings constitute empirical substantiation in mathematics education research for cognition as a complex system transitioning among dynamic equilibria.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Abdu","given":"Rotem"},{"family":"Tancredi","given":"Sofia"},{"family":"Abrahamson","given":"Dor"},{"family":"Balasubramaniam","given":"Ramesh"}],"citation-key":"abduDemonstratingMathematicsLearning2023","container-title":"Educational Studies in Mathematics","container-title-short":"Educ Stud Math","DOI":"10.1007/s10649-023-10279-0","ISSN":"1573-0816","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,29]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"Demonstrating mathematics learning as the emergence of eye–hand dynamic equilibrium","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10649-023-10279-0"},{"id":"ablingerEyeMovementAnalyses2014","abstract":"Background: Psycholinguistic error analysis of dyslexic responses in various reading tasks provides the primary basis for clinically discriminating subtypes of pathological reading. Within this framework, phonology-related errors are indicative of a sequential word processing strategy, whereas lexical and semantic errors are associated with a lexical reading strategy. Despite the large number of published intervention studies, relatively little is known about changes in error distributions during recovery in dyslexic patients. Aims: The main purpose of the present work was to extend the scope of research on the time course of recovery in readers with acquired dyslexia, using eye tracking methodology to examine word processing in real time. The guiding hypothesis was that in lexical readers a reduction of lexical errors and an emerging predominant production of phonological errors should be associated with a change to a more segmental momentto-moment reading behaviour.\nMethods & Procedures: Five patients participated in an eye movement supported reading intervention, where both lexical and segmental reading was facilitated. Reading performance was assessed before (T1) and after (T2) therapy intervention via recording of eye movements. Analyses included a novel way to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of processing using distributions of fixation positions as different time intervals. These subdistributions reveal the gradual shifting of fixation positions during word processing, providing an adequate metric for objective classification of online reading strategies. Outcome & Results: Therapy intervention led to improved reading accuracy in all subjects. In three of five participants, analyses revealed a restructuring in the underlying reading mechanisms from predominantly lexical to more segmental word processing. In contrast, two subjects maintained their lexical reading procedures. Importantly, the fundamental assumption that a high number of phonologically based reading errors must be associated with segmental word processing routines, while the production of lexical errors is indicative of a holistic reading strategy could not be verified.\nConclusions: Our results indicate that despite general improvements in reading performance, only some patients reorganised their word identification process.

One proposal is that synchrony supports and facilitates communication (Topics Cogn Sci 1:305–319, 2009).

In the present study, dyads worked together to construct towers from uncooked spaghetti and marshmallows.

In a selforganizing system, agents make changes while preserving stability. If they do not preserve stability, they push the system toward chaos and cannot recreate it. How changes preserve stability is thus a fundamental issue. In current works, changes preserve stability because agents’ ability to make changes is limited by interaction rules and power. However, how agents diffuse the changes throughout the system while preserving its stability has not been addressed in these works. We have addressed this issue by borrowing from a complex system theory neglected thus far in organization theories: self-organized criticality theory. We suggest that self-organizing systems are in critical states: agents have equivalent ability to make changes, and none are able to foresee or control how their changes diffuse throughout the system. Changes, then, diffuse unpredictably –they may diffuse to small or large parts of the system or not at all, and it is this unpredictable diffusion that preserves stability in the system over time. We call our theoretical framework self-organizing criticality theory. It presents a new treatment of change and stability and improves the understanding of self-organizing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Accard","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"accardCriticalityHowChanges2019","container-title":"Organization Studies","container-title-short":"Organization Studies","DOI":"10.1177/0170840618783342","ISSN":"0170-8406, 1741-3044","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11]]},"language":"en","page":"1613-1629","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Criticality: How Changes Preserve Stability in Self-Organizing Systems","title-short":"Criticality","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0170840618783342","volume":"40"},{"id":"albanEmbodimentMeetsMetamemory2013","abstract":"Weight is conceptualized as an embodiment of importance, according to recent research on embodied cognition (Ackerman, Nocera, & Bargh, 2010; Jostmann, Lakens, & Schubert, 2009).

Theoretical and empirical accounts indicate that large-scale resting state networks reconcile dual tendencies towards integration and segregation by operating in a metastable regime of their coordination dynamics. Metastability may confer important behavioural qualities by binding distributed local areas into large-scale neurocognitive networks. We tested this hypothesis by analysing fMRI data in a large cohort of healthy individuals (N = 566) and comparing the metastability of the brain's large-scale resting network architecture at rest and during the performance of several tasks. Metastability was estimated using a well-defined collective variable capturing the level of 'phase-locking' between large-scale networks over time. Task-based reasoning was principally characterised by high metastability in cognitive control networks and low metastability in sensory processing areas. Although metastability between resting state networks increased during task performance, cognitive ability was more closely linked to spontaneous activity. High metastability in the intrinsic connectivity of cognitive control networks was linked to novel problem solving or fluid intelligence, but was less important in tasks relying on previous experience or crystallised intelligence. Crucially, subjects with resting architectures similar or 'preconfigured' to a task-general arrangement demonstrated superior cognitive performance. Taken together, our findings support a key linkage between the spontaneous metastability of large-scale networks in the cerebral cortex and cognition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Alderson","given":"Thomas H."},{"family":"Bokde","given":"Arun L.

Traditional approaches for analysis of HRV require the signal to be reasonably stationary during the period of observation. This is not possible when analyzing long duration signals. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is robust to this issue, as it removes external interferences (\"trends\") and considers only intrinsic characteristics which are present throughout the signal. DFA is typically performed by segmenting the signal into shorter windows. This has two undesirable effects: (i) if the signal length is not a multiple of the window length, then at least one window will have fewer samples than the others; and (ii) discontinuities are observed on the detrended signal at the edges of each window. Both issues may be addressed using a sliding window. We propose and evaluate this idea, comparing its results with those obtained using the traditional approach. Experiments using different kinds of random and real HRV signals are presented. Statistically significant differences were observed with the proposed approach, especially with respect to .2 values.

Additionally, interacting systems tend to attune their complexities in order to enhance their coordination. This effect has been observed in a number of synchronization experiments, and interpreted as a transfer of multifractality between systems. Finally, it has been shown that when two systems of different complexity levels interact, this transfer of multifractality operates from the most complex system to the less complex, yielding an increase of complexity in the latter. This theoretical framework inspired the present experiment that tested the possible restoration of complexity in older people. In young and healthy participants, walking is known to present 1/f ﬂuctuations, reﬂecting the complexity of the locomotion system, providing walkers with both stability and adaptability. In contrast walking tends to present a more disordered dynamics in older people, and this whitening was shown to correlate with fall propensity. We hypothesized that if an aged participant walked in close synchrony with a young companion, the complexity matching effect should result in the restoration of complexity in the former. Older participants were involved in a prolonged training program of synchronized walking, with a young experimenter. Synchronization within the dyads was dominated by complexity matching. We observed a restoration of complexity in participants after 3 weeks, and this effect was persistent 2 weeks after the end of the training session. This work presents the ﬁrst demonstration of a restoration of complexity in deﬁcient systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Almurad","given":"Zainy M.

We also found that periods of regularity were associated with a reduction in overall behavior. Notably, the production of irregular behavior predicted expert-coded metrics of collaborative activity, such as teams’ ability to construct shared knowledge and effectively negotiate and coordinate execution of solutions, net of overall behavioral production and behavioral self-similarity.

Such analyses capture non-linear fractal dynamics in temporal ﬂuctuations of motor instances that are believed to reﬂect how executive control enlist a coordination of multiple interactions across temporal scales between the brain, the body and the task environment, an essential architecture for adaptation. Here by recruiting elite rugby players with high motor skills and submitting them to the execution of rhythmic motor tasks involving legs and arms concurrently, the main attempt was to build on the multifractal formalism of movement control to show a marginal need of effective adaptation in concurrent tasks, and a preserved adaptability despite complexiﬁed motor execution. The present study applied a multifractal analytical approach to experimental time series and added surrogate data testing based on shufﬂed, ARFIMA, Davies&Harte and phase-randomized surrogates, for assessing scale-free behavior in repeated motor time series obtained while combining cycling with ﬁnger tapping and with circling. Single-tasking was analyzed comparatively. A focus-based multifractal-DFA approach provided Hurst exponents (H) of individual time series over a range of statistical moments H(q), q = [−15 15]. H(2) quantiﬁed monofractality and H(-15)-H(15) provided an index of multifractality. Despite concurrent tasking, participants showed great capacity to keep the target rhythm. Surrogate data testing showed reasonable reliability in using multifractal formalism to decipher movement control behavior. The global (i.e., monofractal) behavior in single-tasks did not change when adapting to dual-task. Multifractality dominated in cycling and did not change when cycling was challenged by upper limb movements. Likewise, tapping and circling behaviors were preserved despite concurrent cycling. It is concluded that the coordinated executive control when adapting to dual-motor tasking is not modiﬁed in people having developed great motor skills through physical training. Executive control likely emerged from multiplicative interactions across temporal scales which puts emphasis on multifractal approaches of the movement system to get critical cues on adaptation. Extending such analyses to less skilled people is appealing in the context of exploring healthy and diseased movement systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Arsac","given":"Laurent M."}],"citation-key":"arsacMultifractalDynamicsExecutive2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Physiology","container-title-short":"Front.

Semiosis self-organizes in time, in a process that continuously entails the production of more signs. Emergence is a ubiquitous condition in this process: the translation of signs into signs cannot be inferred from the properties of the components of a semiotic triad alone, but has to take into account a complex interaction between a micro-semiotic and macro-semiotic level of description. This interaction can be understood as an interplay of potentialities and tendencies, or upward constitutive determinative relations and downward selective determinative relations.

The BPD and control groups had similar initial levels of RSA and heart period. However, during the experiment the groups exhibited contrasting trajectories, with the BPD group decreasing RSA and heart period and the control group increasing RSA and heart period. By the end of the experiment, the groups diﬀer signiﬁcantly on both RSA and heart period. The correlation between the changes in RSA and heart period was signiﬁcant only for the control group, suggesting that vagal mechanisms mediated the heart period responses only in the control group.

We investigated whether performance on a dynamic touch task (length perception by wielding) differ between children with ADHD and age-matched controls. We further examined whether this difference could be explained by fractal temporal correlations (wielding dynamics). Forty-two children (ADHD: 21; typically developing: 21) wielded unseen wooden rods and reported their perceived length in the form of magnitude productions. The rods varied in the magnitude of the first principal moment of inertia (I1). Three-dimensional displacements of hand and rod positions were submitted to Detrended Fluctuation Analysis to estimate trial-by-trial temporal correlations. Children with ADHD reported shorter length for rods with higher I1 than their typically developing peers, indicative of reduced sensitivity to mechanical information supporting dynamic touch. Importantly, temporal correlations in wielding dynamics moderated children’s usage of I1. This finding points to a role of exploratory movements in perceptual deficits presented by children with ADHD and, thus, should be considered a new potential target for interventions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Avelar","given":"Bruna S."},{"family":"Mancini","given":"Marisa C."},{"family":"Fonseca","given":"Sergio T."},{"family":"Kelty-Stephen","given":"Damian G."},{"family":"De Miranda","given":"Débora M."},{"family":"Romano-Silva","given":"Marco Aurélio"},{"family":"De Araújo","given":"Priscila A."},{"family":"Silva","given":"Paula L."}],"citation-key":"avelarFractalFluctuationsExploratory2019","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0217200","editor":[{"family":"Kenet","given":"Tal"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,21]]},"language":"en","page":"e0217200","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Fractal fluctuations in exploratory movements predict differences in dynamic touch capabilities between children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and typical development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217200","volume":"14"},{"id":"avrySharingEmotionsContributes2020","abstract":"Collaborative problem-solving has been gaining attention as more and more students and employees work together all around the world to ﬁnd solutions to complex problems. This trend goes hand in hand with a growing interest in the role of affective processes in learning and problem-solving ﬁelds. However, the comprehension of real-time dynamics between emotional sharing and collaborative exchanges (what we propose to call “collaborative act”) still needs to be deepened. The challenge is especially on understanding the interplay between real-time changes in epistemic and relational dimensions. In this study, we propose to explore this question in dyadic creative problem-solving. Eleven pairs of participants used an argument graph tool to co-create a slogan against violence at school. The tool was used to write down slogans and build a joint map of the group argumentation. During the collaboration, they had access to an emotion awareness tool, allowing them to share emotional labels in real time. An indicator of real-time use was computed to track ongoing changes in collaborative acts during collaboration. Then, using both inferential and descriptive statistics, we ﬁrst investigated whether emotional sharing induces real-time adaptation of both emitter’s and receiver’s collaborative acts. Second, we looked at privileged relationships between emitter’s collaborative acts, emitter’s emotion sharing, and receiver’s collaborative acts. The preliminary results obtained (1) conﬁrm that emotional sharing regulates emitter’s and receiver’s collaborative acts and (2) strongly suggest that speciﬁc emotions mark speciﬁc patterns of collaboration in different collaborative phases, implying both the epistemic and the relational spaces of collaboration. These results highlight the value of studying emotional sharing for a deeper comprehension of the factors regulating collaborative problem-solving. Perspectives in educational psychology and computer science are considered, with the will to understand and promote better self- and co-regulation of collaborative problem-solving through emotional sharing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Avry","given":"Sunny"},{"family":"Molinari","given":"Gaëlle"},{"family":"Bétrancourt","given":"Mireille"},{"family":"Chanel","given":"Guillaume"}],"citation-key":"avrySharingEmotionsContributes2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

From this central position, the leader positively influences team performance.

Moreover, we compared the findings from RQA to classical eye movement measures (number of fixations, mean fixation duration, regression fixation proportion). The results indicated that classical eye movement measures did not predict reading comprehension reliably, whereas recurrences in gaze steps were reliably associated with reading comprehension proficiency. Contrary to our original hypothesis, experts showed more irregular, rather than more regular, eye movement dynamics, and these were linked to more proficient reading comprehension.

To better understand how affective factors can stimulate or impede cognitive elaboration processes, we review research on motivated cognition that has dealt with the influence of arousal, valence, and personal relevance on cognitive depth. The role of affect in defensive information processing (i.e., the motivated neglect or denial of information) is also considered. Specifically, we discuss how research on motivated cognition can help explain thought-provoking entertainment experiences, and the potential of such experiences to stimulate self-reflection and personal growth.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bartsch","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Beth Oliver","given":"Mary"}],"citation-key":"bartschMakingSenseEntertainment2011","container-title":"Journal of Media Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Media Psychology","DOI":"10.1027/1864-1105/a000026","ISSN":"1864-1105, 2151-2388","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",1]]},"language":"en","page":"12-17","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Making Sense of Entertainment: On the Interplay of Emotion and Cognition in Entertainment Experience","title-short":"Making Sense of Entertainment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1864-1105/a000026","volume":"23"},{"id":"batiniAssociationReadingEmotional2020","abstract":"Reading practice is associated with numerous psychological benefits.

Recently, the AESTHEMOS scale has been developed to facilitate the empirical assessment of such emotions. In this article we report a semantic proﬁle analysis of aesthetic emotion terms that had been used for the development of this scale, using the GRID approach. This method consists of obtaining ratings of emotion terms on a set of meaning facets (features) which represent ﬁve components of the emotion process (appraisal, bodily reactions, action tendencies, expression, and feelings). The aims here were (a) to determine the dimensionality of the GRID features when applied to aesthetic emotions and compare it to published results for emotion terms in general, and (b) to examine the internal organization of the domain of aesthetic emotion terms in order to identify salient clusters of these items based on the similarity of their feature proﬁles on the GRID. Exploratory Principal Component Analyses suggest a four-dimensional structure of the semantic space consisting of valence, power, arousal, and novelty, converging with earlier GRID studies on large sets of standard emotion terms. Using cluster analyses, 15 clusters of aesthetic emotion terms with similar GRID feature proﬁles were identiﬁed, revealing the internal organization of the aesthetic emotion terms domain and meaningful subgroups of aesthetic emotions. While replication for further languages is required, these ﬁndings provide a solid basis for further research and methodological development in the realm of aesthetic emotions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Beermann","given":"Ursula"},{"family":"Hosoya","given":"Georg"},{"family":"Schindler","given":"Ines"},{"family":"Scherer","given":"Klaus R."},{"family":"Eid","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Wagner","given":"Valentin"},{"family":"Menninghaus","given":"Winfried"}],"citation-key":"beermannDimensionsClustersAesthetic2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

Areas covered: This review focuses on clinical, actigraphic, biochemical and genetic biomarkers of BDs, as well as animal and cellular models, and highlights that sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances are closely linked to the susceptibility to BDs and vulnerability to mood relapses. As lithium is likely to act as a synchronizer and stabilizer of circadian rhythms, we will review pharmacogenetic studies testing circadian gene polymorphisms and prophylactic response to lithium. Interventions such as sleep deprivation, light therapy and psychological therapies may also target sleep and circadian disruptions in BDs efficiently for treatment and prevention of bipolar depression. Expert opinion: We suggest that future research should clarify the associations between sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances and alterations of the molecular clock in order to identify critical targets within the circadian pathway. The investigation of such targets using human cellular models or animal models combined with ‘omics’ approaches are crucial steps for new drug development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Bellivier","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Geoffroy","given":"Pierre-Alexis"},{"family":"Etain","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Scott","given":"Jan"}],"citation-key":"bellivierSleepCircadianRhythm2015","container-title":"Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Targets","container-title-short":"Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Targets","DOI":"10.1517/14728222.2015.1018822","ISSN":"1472-8222, 1744-7631","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,3]]},"language":"en","page":"747-763","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sleep- and circadian rhythm–associated pathways as therapeutic targets in bipolar disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1517/14728222.2015.1018822","volume":"19"},{"id":"beltzIntrinsicFluctuationsHuman","author":[{"family":"Beltz","given":"Brandon C"},{"family":"Kello","given":"Christopher T"}],"citation-key":"beltzIntrinsicFluctuationsHuman","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"On the Intrinsic Fluctuations of Human Behavior","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"benteBuildingBlocksSuspense2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              The current study explores the role of narrative content and non-diegetic music, as well as their interplay in the creation of film suspense.

Audience responses were assessed with a combination of continuous response measurement (CRM) and psychophysiological measures, comprising heart rate (i.e., inter-beat interval, IBI), pulse volume amplitude (PVA), and skin conductance level (SCL). Frame-by-frame content coding was performed to identify distinct plot segments and musical moods (tense vs. relaxing) and mark the critical visual and auditory events that directed the audience’s inferences about the nature of the plot and elicited specific outcome expectations. Results showed that continuous self-report data and objective physiological measures were largely dissociated, suggesting different processing modalities. Tense music alone induced feelings of suspense (CRM) even in the absence of any clues about the story content. Overall, the audio-only version led to the highest arousal levels, as indicated by SCL and PVA, while the video-only version led to the lowest arousal levels. IBI data revealed short-term heart rate deceleration responses to salient narrative clues that could be interpreted in terms of heightened attention and cognitive resource allocation.

First, we consider the concept of cognition in the spirit of Maturana and Varela: in contradistinction to the representationalistic point of view, cognition is construed as interaction between and mutual definition of a living unit and its environment. The most direct form of cognition for a cell is thus metabolism itself, which necessarily implies exchange with the environment and therefore a simultaneous coming to being for the organism and for the environment. A second level of cognition is recognized in the adaptation of the living unit to new foreign molecules, by way of a change in its metabolic pattern. We draw here an analogy with the ideas developed by Piaget, who recognizes in cognition the two distinct steps of assimilation and accommodation. While\n              assimilation\n              is the equivalent of uptake and exchange of usual metabolites,\n              accommodation\n              corresponds to biological adaptation, which in turn is the basis for evolution. By comparing a micro-organism with a vesicle that uptakes a precursor for its own self-reproduction, we arrive at the conclusion that (a) the very lowest level of cognition is the condition for life, and (b) the lowest level of cognition does not reduce to the lowest level of autopoiesis. As a consequence, autopoiesis alone is only a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for life. The broader consequences of this analysis of cognition for minimal living systems are considered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Bitbol","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Luisi","given":"Pier Luigi"}],"citation-key":"bitbolAutopoiesisCognitionDefining2004","container-title":"Journal of The Royal Society Interface","container-title-short":"J.

In this paper, we follow the contingency theory and characterize dynamic team composition as a design choice that interacts with other choices such as the coordination mode, and with additional contextual factors such as individual learning and task complexity. We employ an agent-based modeling approach based on the NK framework, which includes a reinforcement learning mechanism, a recurring team formation mechanism based on signaling, and three different coordination modes. Our results suggest that by implementing lateral communication or sequential decision-making, teams may exploit the benefits of dynamic composition more than if decision-making is fully autonomous. The choice of a proper coordination mode, however, is partly moderated by the task complexity and individual learning. Additionally, we show that only a coordination mode based on lateral communication may prevent the negative effects of individual learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Blanco-Fernández","given":"Darío"},{"family":"Leitner","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Rausch","given":"Alexandra"}],"citation-key":"blanco-fernandezInteractionsDynamicTeam2024","container-title":"Review of Managerial Science","container-title-short":"Rev Manag Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s11846-024-00731-7","ISSN":"1863-6683, 1863-6691","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,23]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Interactions between dynamic team composition and coordination: an agent-based modeling approach","title-short":"Interactions between dynamic team composition and coordination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11846-024-00731-7"},{"id":"blauFractalStructureEvent2013","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Blau","given":"Julia J.

Humans can simulate nonlinearities in music and soundtracks through the use of technological manipulations. Recent work found that film soundtracks from different genres differentially contain such sounds. We designed two experiments to determine specifically how simulated nonlinearities in soundtracks influence perceptions of arousal and valence. Subjects were presented with emotionally neutral musical exemplars that had neither noise nor abrupt frequency transitions, or versions of these musical exemplars that had noise or abrupt frequency upshifts or downshifts experimentally added. In a second experiment, these acoustic exemplars were paired with benign videos. Judgements of both arousal and valence were altered by the addition of these simulated nonlinearities in the first, music-only, experiment. In the second, multi-modal, experiment, valence (but not arousal) decreased with the addition of noise or frequency downshifts. Thus, the presence of a video image suppressed the ability of simulated nonlinearities to modify arousal. This is the first study examining how nonlinear simulations in music affect emotional judgements. These results demonstrate that the perception of potentially fearful or arousing sounds is influenced by the perceptual context and that the addition of a visual modality can antagonistically suppress the response to an acoustic stimulus.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Blumstein","given":"Daniel T."},{"family":"Bryant","given":"Gregory A."},{"family":"Kaye","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"blumsteinSoundArousalMusic2012","container-title":"Biology Letters","container-title-short":"Biol.

Results also indicate that both leaders' positive emotional expressions and follower mood influenced ratings of leader effectiveness and attraction to the leader.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Bono","given":"Joyce E."},{"family":"Ilies","given":"Remus"}],"citation-key":"bonoCharismaPositiveEmotions2006","container-title":"The Leadership Quarterly","container-title-short":"The Leadership Quarterly","DOI":"10.1016/j.leaqua.2006.04.008","ISSN":"10489843","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",8]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","page":"317-334","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Charisma, positive emotions and mood contagion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S104898430600035X","volume":"17"},{"id":"boonArtisticFormsComplexity","author":[{"family":"Boon","given":"Jean Pierre"},{"family":"Casti","given":"John"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Richard P"}],"citation-key":"boonArtisticFormsComplexity","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Artistic Forms and Complexity","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"boothExpectationsHierarchicalScales2018","abstract":"Reader expectations form across hierarchical scales of discourse (e.g., from coarse to fine: genre, narrative, syntax). Cross-scale interactivity produces word reading times (RTs) with multifractal structure. After introducing multifractals, we test two hypotheses regarding their relevance to reader expectations: (1) multifractal evidence of cross-scale interactions from RTs preceding violation of expectations would interact with mean reading speed to predict RTs immediately after the expectation violation and (2) postsurprise RTs would exhibit stronger cross-scale interactions. Thirty-four adult participants read one of two 2,000-word stories that used gender stereotypes to suggest that an ambiguously named protagonist was male. However, the stories postponed gender information until word 1,000: male in one story and female in the other. For slower readers, cross-scale interactions accentuated postreveal slowing but also minimized subsequent pausing over 15 postreveal RTs. Surprise strengthened cross-scale interactions over all postsurprise RTs. These results suggest that multifractality may index anticipation across multiple scales of discourse.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Booth","given":"Chase R."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Hannah L."},{"family":"Eason","given":"Elizabeth G."},{"family":"Wallot","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Kelty-Stephen","given":"Damian G."}],"citation-key":"boothExpectationsHierarchicalScales2018","container-title":"Discourse Processes","DOI":"10.1080/0163853X.2016.1197811","ISSN":"0163-853X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,2]]},"page":"12–30","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Expectations on Hierarchical Scales of Discourse: Multifractality Predicts Both Short- and Long-Range Effects of Violating Gender Expectations in Text Reading","title-short":"Expectations on Hierarchical Scales of Discourse","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/0163853X.2016.1197811","volume":"55"},{"id":"bosseAgentBasedModelingEmotion2015","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bosse","given":"Tibor"},{"family":"Duell","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Memon","given":"Zulfiqar A."},{"family":"Treur","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Van Der Wal","given":"C.

The main interactions span multiple temporal and spatial scales and are extensively governed by nonlinear processes. Hence, entropy and (multi)fractality in heart period time series are suitable to capture emergent behavior of the cognitive-autonomic network coordination. This study investigated how entropy and multifractal-multiscale analyses could depict speciﬁc cognitive-autonomic architectures reﬂected in the heart rate dynamics when students performed selective inhibition tasks. The participants (N = 37) completed cognitive interference (Stroop color and word task), action cancellation (stop-signal) and action restraint (go/no-go) tasks, compared to watching a neutral movie as baseline. Entropy and fractal markers (respectively, the reﬁned composite multiscale entropy and multifractal-multiscale detrended ﬂuctuation analysis) outperformed other time-domain and frequency-domain markers of the heart rate variability in distinguishing cognitive tasks. Crucially, the entropy increased selectively during cognitive interference and the multifractality increased during action cancellation. An interpretative hypothesis is that cognitive interference elicited a greater richness in interactive processes that form the central autonomic network while action cancellation, which is achieved via biasing a sensorimotor network, could lead to a scale-speciﬁc heightening of multifractal behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Bouny","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Arsac","given":"Laurent M."},{"family":"Touré Cuq","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Deschodt-Arsac","given":"Veronique"}],"citation-key":"bounyEntropyMultifractalMultiscaleIndices2021","container-title":"Entropy","container-title-short":"Entropy","DOI":"10.3390/e23060663","ISSN":"1099-4300","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,25]]},"language":"en","page":"663","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Entropy and Multifractal-Multiscale Indices of Heart Rate Time Series to Evaluate Intricate Cognitive-Autonomic Interactions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/6/663","volume":"23"},{"id":"braniganProcessPhilosophyFramework2019","abstract":"Process Philosophy has a long history as a disciplined way of thinking about the world.

All sorts of unpredictable and unexpected things happen but typically people are able to skillfully adapt. In this paper, we address two key questions in cognitive science. First, how is an agent able to bring its previously learned skill to bear on a novel situation? Second, how can an agent be both sensitive to the particularity of a given situation, while remaining flexibly poised for many other possibilities for action? We will argue that both the sensitivity to novel situations and the sensitivity to a multiplicity of action possibilities are enabled by the property of skilled agency that we will call metastable attunement. We characterize a skilled agent’s flexible interactions with a dynamically changing environment in terms of metastable dynamics in agent-environment systems. What we find in metastability is the realization of two competing tendencies: the tendency of the agent to express their intrinsic dynamics and the tendency to search for new possibilities. Metastably attuned agents are ready to engage with a multiplicity of affordances, allowing for a balance between stability and flexibility. On the one hand, agents are able to exploit affordances they are attuned to, while at the same time being ready to flexibly explore for other affordances. Metastable attunement allows agents to smoothly transition between these possible configurations so as to adapt their behaviour to what the particular situation requires. We go on to describe the role metastability plays in learning of new skills, and in skilful behaviour more generally. Finally, drawing upon work in art, architecture and sports science, we develop a number of perspectives on how to investigate metastable attunement in real life situations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Bruineberg","given":"Jelle"},{"family":"Seifert","given":"Ludovic"},{"family":"Rietveld","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Kiverstein","given":"Julian"}],"citation-key":"bruinebergMetastableAttunementReallife2021","container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-021-03355-6","ISSN":"0039-7857, 1573-0964","issue":"5-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"12819-12842","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Metastable attunement and real-life skilled behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11229-021-03355-6","volume":"199"},{"id":"bruinebergProductivePluralismComing2023","abstract":"The ecological approach to psychology has been a main antecedent of embodied and situated approaches to cognition. The concept of affordances in particular has gained currency throughout psychological science. Yet contemporary ecological psychology has seemed inaccessible to outsiders and protective of its legacy. Indeed, some prominent ecological psychologists have presented their approach as a “package deal”—a principled and unified perspective on perception and action. Looking at the history of the field, however, we argue that ecological psychology has developed in rich and pluriform ways. Aiming to open the field to critical engagement and productive exchange, we identify three major strands of thought within ecological psychology, each of which emerged in the 20 years after Gibson’s death: physical, biological and social ecological psychology. Each of these strands develop ecological ideas in quite different directions, making different use of some of its central concepts, adopting different explanatory principles, and embodying different philosophical worldviews. Proponents of the ecological approach have been arguing for pluralism within cognitive science to make room for ecological psychology. Given the diversity of the strands, we extend this plea to within ecological psychology itself; the field is better off aiming for a productive pluralism in which the different strands are in dialogue with each other.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bruineberg","given":"Jelle"},{"family":"Withagen","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Van Dijk","given":"Ludger"}],"citation-key":"bruinebergProductivePluralismComing2023","container-title":"Psychological Review","container-title-short":"Psychological Review","DOI":"10.1037/rev0000438","ISSN":"1939-1471, 0033-295X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,20]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Productive pluralism: The coming of age of ecological psychology.","title-short":"Productive pluralism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/rev0000438"},{"id":"bruinebergSelforganizationFreeEnergy2014","abstract":"In this paper, we set out to develop a theoretical and conceptual framework for the new ﬁeld of Radical Embodied Cognitive Neuroscience. This framework should be able to integrate insights from several relevant disciplines: theory on embodied cognition, ecological psychology, phenomenology, dynamical systems theory, and neurodynamics. We suggest that the main task of Radical Embodied Cognitive Neuroscience is to investigate the phenomenon of skilled intentionality from the perspective of the self-organization of the brain-body-environment system, while doing justice to the phenomenology of skilled action. In previous work, we have characterized skilled intentionality as the organism’s tendency toward an optimal grip on multiple relevant affordances simultaneously. Affordances are possibilities for action provided by the environment. In the ﬁrst part of this paper, we introduce the notion of skilled intentionality and the phenomenon of responsiveness to a ﬁeld of relevant affordances. Second, we use Friston’s work on neurodynamics, but embed a very minimal version of his Free Energy Principle in the ecological niche of the animal. Thus amended, this principle is helpful for understanding the embeddedness of neurodynamics within the dynamics of the system “brain-body-landscape of affordances.” Next, we show how we can use this adjusted principle to understand the neurodynamics of selective openness to the environment: interacting action-readiness patterns at multiple timescales contribute to the organism’s selective openness to relevant affordances. In the ﬁnal part of the paper, we emphasize the important role of metastable dynamics in both the brain and the brain-body-environment system for adequate affordance-responsiveness. We exemplify our integrative approach by presenting research on the impact of Deep Brain Stimulation on affordance responsiveness of OCD patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Bruineberg","given":"Jelle"},{"family":"Rietveld","given":"Erik"}],"citation-key":"bruinebergSelforganizationFreeEnergy2014","container-title":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

We discuss two previous attempts to integrate affordances with neuroscience: Reed’s ecological rendering of Edelman’s selectionism as well as Dreyfus’ phenomenological interpretation of Freeman’s neurodynamics. Reed and Dreyfus face the problem of how to account for “value.” We then show how the freeenergy principle, an increasingly dominant framework in theoretical neuroscience, is rooted in both Freeman’s neurodynamics and Edelman’s selectionism. The free-energy principle accounts for value in terms of selective anticipation. The selection pressures at work on the agent shape its selective sensitivity to the relevant affordances in the environment.

To address this limitation, participants performed aiming movements to targets in the up and down directions with the index ﬁnger and two types of rod extensions attached to the index ﬁnger. The rod extensions were expected to invoke different energy optimizing strategies in the up and down directions by allowing the distal joints the opportunity to contribute to end effector displacement. Primary movements undershot the farthest target to a greater extent in the downward direction compared to the upward direction, showing that movement kinematics optimize energy expenditure in consideration of the effects of gravity. As rod length increased, shoulder elevation was optimized in movements to the far-up target and elbow ﬂexion was optimally minimized in movements to the far-down target.

By looking closely at highly context-dependent instances of memorizing and recalling dance material, I aim at shedding light on the workings of memory. Challenging the view that cognition fundamentally entails contentful mental representation, the examples I discuss attest the existence of non-representational instances of memory, accommodating episodic memory. That being so, this paper also makes room for content-involving forms of remembering. As a result, it supports the duplex vision of mentality advanced by the REC framework. Building on research on the enactive imagination, I suggest that contentless forms of remembering act below content-involving forms. In addition, contentless and contentful forms of remembering a movement are revealed as the product of culturally scaffolded engagements with others and the environment, in which direct perception and mirroring play a fundamental role. It is argued that many of the practices of remembering a movement are best explained as enactments or re-enactments of such direct ecological perceptions. In the process, the dance studio proves to be a paradigm of the extensive mind. This paper is also intended as an invitation to the REC framework to extend the family and explicitly embrace research on sociocultural practices as an equal partner, including dance studies. Given the fundamental role that sociocultural practices play in REC’s understanding of cognition, it is only natural that further radicalization goes along those lines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Carmona","given":"Carla"}],"citation-key":"carmonaPracticesRememberingMovement2021","container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-020-02949-w","ISSN":"0039-7857, 1573-0964","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"3611-3643","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Practices of remembering a movement in the dance studio: evidence for (a radicalized version of) the REC framework in the domain of memory","title-short":"Practices of remembering a movement in the dance studio","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11229-020-02949-w","volume":"199"},{"id":"carrHeartRateVariability2018","abstract":"Heart rate variability (HRV) in psychiatric disorders has become an increasing area of interest in recent years following technological advances that enable non-invasive monitoring of autonomic nervous system regulation.

The value of the exponent alpha differentiates different types of coordination states: synchronization and syncopation. More interesting, evidence was found that alpha can be changed when participants use different coordination strategies. Together with the authors' understanding of the generation mechanism for long memory processes, these results suggest that 1/f(alpha) type of long-range correlated timing errors are of higher cortical origin and are likely the outcome of distributed neural processes acting on multiple time scales.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Y."},{"family":"Ding","given":"M."},{"family":"Kelso","given":"J.

Examining 1.8 billion citations among 90 million papers across 241 subjects, we find a deluge of papers does not lead to turnover of central ideas in a field, but rather to ossification of canon. Scholars in fields where many papers are published annually face difficulty getting published, read, and cited unless their work references already widely cited articles. New papers containing potentially important contributions cannot garner field-wide attention through gradual processes of diffusion. These findings suggest fundamental progress may be stymied if quantitative growth of scientific endeavors—in number of scientists, institutes, and papers—is not balanced by structures fostering disruptive scholarship and focusing attention on novel ideas.\n          , \n            In many academic fields, the number of papers published each year has increased significantly over time. Policy measures aim to increase the quantity of scientists, research funding, and scientific output, which is measured by the number of papers produced. These quantitative metrics determine the career trajectories of scholars and evaluations of academic departments, institutions, and nations. Whether and how these increases in the numbers of scientists and papers translate into advances in knowledge is unclear, however. Here, we first lay out a theoretical argument for why too many papers published each year in a field can lead to stagnation rather than advance. The deluge of new papers may deprive reviewers and readers the cognitive slack required to fully recognize and understand novel ideas. Competition among many new ideas may prevent the gradual accumulation of focused attention on a promising new idea. Then, we show data supporting the predictions of this theory. When the number of papers published per year in a scientific field grows large, citations flow disproportionately to already well-cited papers; the list of most-cited papers ossifies; new papers are unlikely to ever become highly cited, and when they do, it is not through a gradual, cumulative process of attention gathering; and newly published papers become unlikely to disrupt existing work. These findings suggest that the progress of large scientific fields may be slowed, trapped in existing canon. Policy measures shifting how scientific work is produced, disseminated, consumed, and rewarded may be called for to push fields into new, more fertile areas of study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Chu","given":"Johan S.

After a critical analysis of the predominant model architecture, based on the concept of a causal chain of components, we introduce interaction-dominant modelling as an alternative. This type of model is based on the theory of complex dynamical systems. Subsequently, two important concepts of the general theory are discussed, viz. synergetics and metastability, and how they apply to art experiences.

However, indicators are also suggesting that curriculum for undergraduate STEM is overly prescriptive and not based upon authentic practices, and are thus not representative of the professions and unattractive to the widest possible population of students. To address this problem, this chapter conceptualizes collaborative problem solving as a core STEM practice and takes a design-based approach to the discussion of conceptual and empirical research on scaffolding the process with cyberlearning. Cyberlearning, or the use of networked learning technologies, can transform the scaffolding of both individual and collective cognition because it provides affordances for learners to engage in such important cognitive and metacognitive processes as problem definition, information discrimination, reasoning and argumentation, solution negotiation and evaluation. In addition to supporting learners’ cognitive processes, such as elaboration or problem categorization, cyberlearning environments scaffold metacognition—that is, planning, differentiating forms of knowledge and information, as well as monitoring, and reflective activities. Similar to the scaffolding of cognition, cyberlearning technologies allow designers to create supports for both individual learners’ metacognition (i.e., self-regulation) as well as team metacognition (i.e., socially shared regulation). The design-based approach we describe in this chapter leverages the complex interplay among cognition and metacognition to generate engaging and inclusive cyberlearning experiences. We begin by reviewing the existing theories that inform the complex process, then translate these theories into a design framework that defines a STEM learning environment based upon collaborative problem solving. Drawing from current examples, the design is instantiated as cyberlearning by aligning the needs of the activities and experiences with the affordances of contemporary technologies. We conclude the chapter with the implications of our approach for future research, teaching and assessment.","author":[{"family":"Crippen","given":"Kent"},{"family":"Antonenko","given":"Pavlo \"Pasha"}],"citation-key":"crippenDesigningCollaborativeProblem2018","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-66659-4_5","ISBN":"978-3-319-66657-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,1]]},"page":"89-116","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Designing for Collaborative Problem Solving in STEM Cyberlearning","type":"chapter"},{"id":"cromleyReadingAchievementScience2009","abstract":"Students need to develop scientific literacy in order to participate fully as citizens, community members, and in the globalized economy.

Narrative form, on the other hand, appears to have been relatively unchanged over that time and is often characterized as having four more or less equal duration parts, sometimes called acts – setup, complication, development, and climax. The altered patterns in film style found here affect a movie’s pace: increasing shot durations and decreasing motion in the setup, darkening across the complication and development followed by brightening across the climax, decreasing shot durations and increasing motion during the first part of the climax followed by increasing shot durations and decreasing motion at the end of the climax. Decreasing shot durations mean more cuts; more cuts mean potentially more saccades that drive attention; more motion also captures attention; and brighter and darker images are associated with positive and negative emotions.

These acts are based on the structure of the narrative, and would not necessarily have a physical manifestation in shots and transitions. Nonetheless, exploring a sample of 150 Hollywood style films from 1935 to 2005, this article demonstrates that acts shape shot lengths and transitions.

One reason for this is that storytelling is culturally important to us, but another is that general narrative formulae have been honed over millennia and that a derived but specific filmic form has developed and has been perfected over the last century. The result is a highly effective format that allows rapid processing of complex narratives. Using a corpus analysis I explore a physical narratology of popular movies—narrational structure and how it impacts us—to promote a theory of popular movie form. I show that movies can be divided into 4 acts—setup, complication, development, and climax—with two optional subunits of prolog and epilog, and a few turning points and plot points. In 12 studies I show that normative aspects in patterns of shot durations, shot transitions, shot scale, shot motion, shot luminance, character introduction, and distributions of conversations, music, action shots, and scene transitions reduce to 5 correlated stylistic dimensions of movies and can litigate among theories of movie structure. In general, movie narratives have roughly the same structure as narratives in any other domain—plays, novels, manga, folktales, even oral histories—but with particular runtime constraints, cadences, and constructions that are unique to the medium.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Cutting","given":"James E."}],"citation-key":"cuttingNarrativeTheoryDynamics2016","container-title":"Psychonomic Bulletin & Review","container-title-short":"Psychon Bull Rev","DOI":"10.3758/s13423-016-1051-4","ISSN":"1069-9384, 1531-5320","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1713-1743","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Narrative theory and the dynamics of popular movies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.3758/s13423-016-1051-4","volume":"23"},{"id":"cuttingPerceivingEventDynamics2012","author":[{"family":"Cutting","given":"James E"},{"family":"Brunick","given":"Kaitlin L"},{"family":"Candan","given":"Ayse"}],"citation-key":"cuttingPerceivingEventDynamics2012","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"title":"Perceiving Event dynamics and parsing Hollywood films","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"cuttingPerceivingScenesFilm2005","author":[{"family":"Cutting","given":"James E"}],"citation-key":"cuttingPerceivingScenesFilm2005","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"title":"Perceiving Scenes in Film and in the World","type":"chapter"},{"id":"cuttingRePresentationsSpaceHollywood2014","author":[{"family":"Cutting","given":"James E"}],"citation-key":"cuttingRePresentationsSpaceHollywood2014","container-title":"Cognitive Science","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"title":"Re‐Presentations of Space in Hollywood Movies  An Event‐Indexing Analysis","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"cuttingSequencesPopularCinema2019","abstract":"Popular movies have an event structure that includes scenes and sequences. Scenes are fashioned to be perceived as smoothly flowing, a feature called continuity. Discontinuity is said to occur when scene (event) boundaries are crossed. This article focuses on the structure and perception of sequences that have subscenes (i.e., scene-like components) but whose boundaries, unlike those of scenes, tend to demonstrate some perceived continuity. Although the structure of sequences has been addressed by film theory, this topic has not received psychological attention. Here, data are used from viewer judgments and physical measurements of 24 popular movies, released from 1940 to 2010. Each film was inspected for narrative shift patterns—that is, changes in location, character, or time—across shots. Sequences were determined by repeated shift types, common sound coverage, and the shorter durations of subscenes than of scenes. By these criteria, sequences have increased in movies over time. The results also show that viewer judgments of event boundaries diminish in the presence of music and of shorter and less modulated shot durations. These results fit snugly within event segmentation theory, and this categorization of movie sequences by narrative shifts can accommodate previous accounts of sequence structure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Cutting","given":"James E."}],"citation-key":"cuttingSequencesPopularCinema2019","container-title":"Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics","container-title-short":"Atten Percept Psychophys","DOI":"10.3758/s13414-019-01757-w","ISSN":"1943-3921, 1943-393X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8]]},"language":"en","page":"2014-2025","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sequences in popular cinema generate inconsistent event segmentation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.3758/s13414-019-01757-w","volume":"81"},{"id":"cuttingShapingEditsCreating2019","abstract":"We investigated physical changes over three versions in the production of the short historical drama, Woman with an Editing Bench (2016, The Physical TV Company).

They can be analyzed through Fourier and power analyses, and other methods. Cutting, DeLong, and Nothelfer (2010) analyzed as time-series data the fluctuations of shot durations in 150 popular movies released over 70 years. They found that these patterns had become increasingly fractal-like and concluded that they might be linked to those found in the results of psychological tasks involving attention. To explore this possibility further, we began by analyzing the shot patterns of almost twice as many movies released over a century. The increasing fractal-like nature of shot patterns is affirmed, as determined by both a slope measure and a long-range dependence measure, neither of which is sensitive to the vector lengths of their inputs within the ranges explored here. But the main reason for increased long-range dependence is related to, but not caused by, the increasing vector length of the shot-series samples. It appears that, in generating increasingly fractallike patterns, filmmakers have systematically explored dimensions that are important for holding our attention—shot durations, scene durations, motion, and sound amplitude—and have crafted fluctuations in them like those of our endogenous attention patterns. Other dimensions—luminance, clutter, and shot scale—are important to film style but their variations seem not to be important to holding viewers’ moment-to-moment attention and have not changed in their fractional dimension over time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Cutting","given":"James E."},{"family":"DeLong","given":"Jordan E."},{"family":"Brunick","given":"Kaitlin L."}],"citation-key":"cuttingTemporalFractalsMovies2018","container-title":"Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications","container-title-short":"Cogn.

However, there are substantial individual differences in affective responses to stress. High-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), a marker of vagally-mediated parasympathetic activity, has been conceptualized as a psychophysiological index of emotion regulation that may moderate individuals’ responses to stress. Using a daily diary design, we tested whether individual differ­ ences in resting HF-HRV moderated the association between daily child-related stress and negative affect among a sample of 84 heterosexual couples with preschool-aged children. After controlling for participants’ age, gender, socioeconomic status, employment status, and ethnicity, hierarchical linear modeling revealed that resting HFHRV moderated both the between-person and within-person associations between self-reported child-related stress and daily negative affect. Between-person analyses indicated that the strength of the positive association between mean daily child stress and negative affect across the daily diary period increased with decreasing resting HF-HRV. Similarly, within-person analyses indicated that on days when participants reported more childrelated stress than usual, the magnitude of the increase in negative affect on that day was inversely related to resting HF-HRV. Taken together, these findings suggest that lower resting HF-HRV may index vulnerability to stress-related disturbances in negative affect. This increased negative affective response to daily stress may be one pathway through which individuals with lower resting HF-HRV are at increased risk for depressive symp­ toms over time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Da Estrela","given":"Chelsea"},{"family":"MacNeil","given":"Sasha"},{"family":"Gouin","given":"Jean-Philippe"}],"citation-key":"daestrelaHeartRateVariability2021","container-title":"International Journal of Psychophysiology","container-title-short":"International Journal of Psychophysiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2021.02.001","ISSN":"01678760","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4]]},"language":"en","page":"79-85","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Heart rate variability moderates the between- and within-person associations between daily stress and negative affect","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167876021000404","volume":"162"},{"id":"dagostinoUsingBloomsRevised2015","author":[{"family":"Dagostino","given":"Lorraine"},{"family":"Carifio","given":"James"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Jennifer D C"},{"family":"Hashim","given":"Nor Hashimah"}],"citation-key":"dagostinoUsingBloomsRevised2015","container-title":"Current Issues in Education","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Using Bloom’s Revised Taxonomy to Analyze a Reading Comprehension Instrument","type":"article-journal","volume":"18"},{"id":"deanMotionEnergyAnalysis2019","abstract":"Background—Growing evidence suggests that movement abnormalities occur prior to the onset of psychosis.

For this reason, it is important to examine the dynamic nature of teammate trust through real-time measures of team interactions. This article examines team interaction and trust to understand better how they change under automation and autonomy failures. Thus, we address two research questions: 1) How does trust in HATs evolve over time?; and 2) How is the relationship between team interaction and trust impacted by the failures? We hypothesize that trust in HATs will decrease as autonomy failures increase. We also hypothesize that team interaction would be related to the development of trust and recovery from the failures. The results implicate three general trends: 1) team interaction dynamics are linked to the development of trust in HATs; 2) trust in the autonomous teammate is only associated with recovery from autonomy failures; 3) team interaction dynamics are related to both automation and autonomy failure recovery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Demir","given":"Mustafa"},{"family":"McNeese","given":"Nathan J."},{"family":"Gorman","given":"Jaime C."},{"family":"Cooke","given":"Nancy J."},{"family":"Myers","given":"Christopher W."},{"family":"Grimm","given":"David A."}],"citation-key":"demirExplorationTeammateTrust2021","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

In this study, there were three conditions based on manipulation of the pilot role: (1) synthetic condition - the pilot role was played by a synthetic agent, (2) control condition - it was a randomly assigned participant, and (3) experimenter condition - it was an expert who used a role-specific coordination script. Overall findings indicate that when teams in the experimenter condition come across the targets, they tend to explore alternatives by coordinating as a team rather than exploiting existing team strategies which may not work best for the situation at hand.

A major question for scientists has been to discover the (cognitive) mechanism that underlies the control of human behavior in real-time, as well as cognitive development on the long-term. This chapter will discuss two kinds of general approaches, which we shall refer to as the reductionist approach and the complex dynamic systems (CDS) approach. Roughly speaking, the reductionist approach assumes that separate cognitive components, such as brain areas or processing mechanisms, are primarily responsible for behavior and development, by processing (and responding to) specific environmental cues. The CDS approach assumes that cognition, and thereby the control of behavior and development, are distributed over the brain, body, and environment, which continuously interact over time. The aim of this chapter is to compare the two approaches in terms of their assumptions, research strategies, and analyses. Furthermore, we will discuss the extent to which current research data in the cognitive domain can be explained by the two different approaches. Based on this review, we conclude that the CDS approach, which assumes a ‘complex’ rather than a ‘complicated’ model of cognition, provides the most plausible approach to cognition.","author":[{"family":"Den Hartigh","given":"Ruud"},{"family":"Cox","given":"Ralf"},{"family":"geert","given":"Paul","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"denhartighComplexComplicatedModels2017","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-30526-4","ISBN":"978-3-319-30526-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5,29]]},"page":"657-669","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Complex versus Complicated Models of Cognition","type":"chapter"},{"id":"deres-cohenNonverbalSynchronyMarker2021","abstract":"Clinical Impact Statement Question: Can nonverbal synchrony between patients and therapists serve as a marker of alliance ruptures?

DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), Public Affairs Information Service (PAIS), Industrial and Labor Relations Review (ILLR), PsychInfo, and Ageline from 1980 to 2003. STUDY SELECTION: We included observational studies that reported original data, measured literacy with any valid instrument, and measured one or more health outcomes. Two abstractors reviewed each study for inclusion and resolved disagreements by discussion. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer abstracted data from each article into an evidence table; the second reviewer checked each entry. The whole study team reconciled disagreements about information in evidence tables. Both data extractors independently completed an 11-item quality scale for each article; scores were averaged to give a final measure of article quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: We reviewed 3,015 titles and abstracts and pulled 684 articles for full review; 73 articles met inclusion criteria and, of those, 44 addressed the questions of this report. Patients with low literacy had poorer health outcomes, including knowledge, intermediate disease markers, measures of morbidity, general health status, and use of health resources. Patients with low literacy were generally 1.5 to 3 times more likely to experience a given poor outcome. The average quality of the articles was fair to good. Most studies were cross-sectional in design; many failed to address adequately confounding and the use of multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Low literacy is associated with several adverse health outcomes. Future research, using more rigorous methods, will better define these relationships and guide developers of new interventions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"DeWalt","given":"Darren A."},{"family":"Berkman","given":"Nancy D."},{"family":"Sheridan","given":"Stacey"},{"family":"Lohr","given":"Kathleen N."},{"family":"Pignone","given":"Michael P."}],"citation-key":"dewaltLiteracyHealthOutcomes2004","container-title":"Journal of General Internal Medicine","DOI":"10.1111/j.1525-1497.2004.40153.x","ISSN":"1525-1497","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","page":"1228-1239","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Literacy and Health Outcomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1525-1497.2004.40153.x","volume":"19"},{"id":"deweerdCredencebasedTheoryheavyApproach","abstract":"Many different methodological approaches have been proposed to infer the presence of consciousness in non-human systems. In this paper, a version of the theory-heavy approach is defended. Theory-heavy approaches rely heavily on considerations from theories of consciousness to make inferences about non-human consciousness. Recently, the theory-heavy approach has been critiqued in the form of Birch's (Noûs, 56(1): 133-153, 2022) dilemma of demandingness and Shevlin's (Mind & Language, 36(2): 297-314, 2021) specificity problem. I argue that an alternative characterization of the approach avoids these challenges; a so-called credence-based theory-heavy approach. Theorists can generate interpretations of their theory, at different levels of generality, and operationalize these into theory-informed markers. These theory-informed are assigned a likelihood and are used to assess the probability that a target system is conscious. In addition, some remaining challenges for this approach are discussed, most notably a consensus problem and the problem of calibrating the likelihoods associated with theory-informed markers. Lastly, I explore methodological pluralism and assess how the credence-based theory-heavy approach can benefit from other methodological approaches.","author":[{"family":"Weerd","given":"Christian","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"deweerdCredencebasedTheoryheavyApproach","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"A Credence-based Theory-heavy Approach to Non-human Consciousness","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"dewitWhatShouldGibsonian2019","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"De Wit","given":"Matthieu M."},{"family":"Withagen","given":"Rob"}],"citation-key":"dewitWhatShouldGibsonian2019","container-title":"Ecological Psychology","container-title-short":"Ecological Psychology","DOI":"10.1080/10407413.2019.1615203","ISSN":"1040-7413, 1532-6969","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,3]]},"language":"en","page":"147-151","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"What Should A “Gibsonian Neuroscience” Look Like?

The reviewed studies indicate that this consolidating effect is not revealed under all circumstances but is linked to speciﬁc psychological conditions. Speciﬁcally, we discuss to what extent memory consolidation during sleep depends on the type of learning materials, type of learning and retrieval test, different features of sleep and the subject population. Post-learning sleep enhances consolidation of declarative, procedural and emotional memories. The enhancement is greater for weakly than strongly encoded associations and more consistent for explicitly than implicitly encoded memories. Memories associated with expected reward gain preferentially access to sleep-dependent consolidation. For declarative memories, sleep beneﬁts are more consistently revealed with recall than recognition procedures at retrieval testing. Slow wave sleep (SWS) particularly enhances declarative memories whereas rapid eye movement (REM) sleep preferentially supports procedural and emotional memory aspects. Declarative memory proﬁts already from rather short sleep periods (1–2 h). Procedural memory proﬁts seem more dose-dependent on the amount of sleep following the day after learning. Children’s sleep with high amounts of SWS distinctly enhances declarative memories whereas elderly and psychiatric patients with disturbed sleep show impaired sleep-associated consolidation often of declarative memories. Based on the constellation of psychological conditions identiﬁed we hypothesize that access to sleep-dependent consolidation requires memories to be encoded under control of prefrontalhippocampal circuitry, with the same circuitry controlling subsequent consolidation during sleep.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Diekelmann","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Wilhelm","given":"Ines"},{"family":"Born","given":"Jan"}],"citation-key":"diekelmannWhatsWhensSleepdependent2009","container-title":"Sleep Medicine Reviews","container-title-short":"Sleep Medicine Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.smrv.2008.08.002","ISSN":"10870792","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",10]]},"language":"en","page":"309-321","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The whats and whens of sleep-dependent memory consolidation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1087079208001020","volume":"13"},{"id":"dijkstraMechanismsEmbodiment2015","abstract":"This paper is a critical review of recent studies demonstrating the mechanism of sensorimotor simulation in different cognitive domains.

Cross-recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis was applied on the detected facial emotions to see the level and direction of emotional mimicry among the dyads in the same groups.

We aimed at exploring the possibilities of motivating, fascinating, and experiential elements of virtual reality (VR) in a collaborative learning context, with a focus on emotional contagion. We adopted the eSports mode as a competency development strategy in collaborative learning, using VR to evaluate emotional contagion that is invoked between the presenters and spectators. For this purpose, we created a VR application (HHVR) that allows freshmen students to learn about the premises and academic life at a university. We then divided 43 adult participants into presenters (N = 9) and spectators (N = 34); the presenters experienced the HHVR application first-hand, whereas the spectators watched the experience through a monitor. We used a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews to measure what feelings of being — existential feelings that affect the way we react to the world — the participants experienced. The collected data were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis and qualitative data coding and the results revealed emotional contagion; the spectators who followed the presenters on a monitor showed similar emotional engagement with the presenters who used the application. In conclusion, the proposed eSports mode can be a useful pedagogical technique in the context of collaborative learning with VR, as it engages emotionally both the presenters and spectators. These findings can be helpful for designing emotionally engaging collaborative learning experiences with VR and for conducting group-based UX evaluations of VR applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Dirin","given":"Amir"},{"family":"Nieminen","given":"Marko"},{"family":"Laine","given":"Teemu H."},{"family":"Nieminen","given":"Lassi"},{"family":"Ghalebani","given":"Leila"}],"citation-key":"dirinEmotionalContagionCollaborative2023","container-title":"Education and Information Technologies","container-title-short":"Educ Inf Technol","DOI":"10.1007/s10639-023-11769-7","ISSN":"1360-2357, 1573-7608","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11]]},"language":"en","page":"15317-15363","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Emotional Contagion in Collaborative Virtual Reality Learning Experiences: An eSports Approach","title-short":"Emotional Contagion in Collaborative Virtual Reality Learning Experiences","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10639-023-11769-7","volume":"28"},{"id":"dixonMultifractalDynamicsEmergence2012","abstract":"The complex-systems approach to cognitive science seeks to move beyond the formalism of information exchange and to situate cognition within the broader formalism of energy ﬂow.

The results partially confirmed predictions of goal-appraisal theories of emotion by supporting a tripartite classification of the states along a temporal dimension: persistent states (boredom, engagement/flow, and confusion), transitory states (delight and surprise), and an intermediate state (frustration). Patterns of decay rates were generally consistent across affect judges, except that a reversed actor-observer effect was discovered for engagement/flow and frustration. Correlations between decay rates of the cognitive-affective states and several learning measures confirmed the major predictions and uncovered some novel findings that have implications for theories of pedagogy that integrate cognition and affect during deep learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"D'Mello","given":"Sidney"},{"family":"Graesser","given":"Art"}],"citation-key":"dmelloHalflifeCognitiveaffectiveStates2011","container-title":"Cognition and Emotion","container-title-short":"Cognition and Emotion","DOI":"10.1080/02699931.2011.613668","ISSN":"0269-9931, 1464-0600","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",11]]},"language":"en","page":"1299-1308","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The half-life of cognitive-affective states during complex learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2011.613668","volume":"25"},{"id":"dmelloMultimodalSemiautomatedAffect2010","abstract":"We developed and evaluated a multimodal affect detector that combines conversational cues, gross body language, and facial features. The multimodal affect detector uses feature-level fusion to combine the sensory channels and linear discriminant analyses to discriminate between naturally occurring experiences of boredom, engagement/flow, confusion, frustration, delight, and neutral. Training and validation data for the affect detector were collected in a study where 28 learners completed a 32- min. tutorial session with AutoTutor, an intelligent tutoring system with conversational dialogue. Classification results supported a channel × judgment type interaction, where the face was the most diagnostic channel for spontaneous affect judgments (i.e., at any time in the tutorial session), while conversational cues were superior for fixed judgments (i.e., every 20 s in the session). The analyses also indicated that the accuracy of the multichannel model (face, dialogue, and posture) was statistically higher than the best single-channel model for the fixed but not spontaneous affect expressions. However, multichannel models reduced the discrepancy (i.e., variance in the precision of the different emotions) of the discriminant models for both judgment types. The results also indicated that the combination of channels yielded superadditive effects for some affective states, but additive, redundant, and inhibitory effects for others. We explore the structure of the multimodal linear discriminant models and discuss the implications of some of our major findings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"D’Mello","given":"Sidney K."},{"family":"Graesser","given":"Arthur"}],"citation-key":"dmelloMultimodalSemiautomatedAffect2010","container-title":"User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction","container-title-short":"User Model User-Adap Inter","DOI":"10.1007/s11257-010-9074-4","ISSN":"1573-1391","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"147-187","source":"Springer Link","title":"Multimodal semi-automated affect detection from conversational cues, gross body language, and facial features","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11257-010-9074-4","volume":"20"},{"id":"dojbakhakonssonExplorationExploitationEmotions2016","abstract":"We analyze performance and emotions as antecedents and consequences of team strategic decisions to explore a new routine versus exploiting an existing one.

A distinguishing characteristic of noetic feelings is how they are crucially related to the facts we know, so much so that the activation of semantic memory can easily result in the pro­ duction of noetic feelings – a regularity that memory research has often exploited. And yet little is known about the mechanism that produces noetic feelings. Is it solely brain-based or does it depend upon the extracerebral body for its production of feelings? To arrive at an answer, various studies in metamemory research will be analyzed to deter­ mine what ought to be made of the mechanism responsible for noetic feelings.

In this study, we explored academic reading behaviors by examining eye movements of 27 graduate students and 18 professors as they read 6 authentic research texts for various purposes (summary, analysis, synthesis). Results of factorial ANOVAs showed no differences between students and professors but did reveal that both groups spent far less time looking at citations than surrounding text and that reading purposes affected citation reading behavior. These results indicate that students and professors read academic citations in similar ways.

This research examines the differences in the search behaviors and physiologies of people who are engaged or frustrated during search. A 2x2 within-subject laboratory experiment was conducted with 40 participants. Engagement was induced by manipulating task interest and frustration was induced by manipulating the quality of the search results. Participants' interactions and physiological responses were recorded, and after they searched, they evaluated their levels of engagement, frustration and stress. Participants reported significantly greater levels of engagement when completing tasks that interested them and significantly less engagement during searches with poor results quality. For all search behaviors measured, only two significant differences were found according to task interest: participants had more scrolls and longer query intervals when searching for interesting tasks, suggesting greater interaction with content. Significant differences were found for nine behaviors according to results quality, including queries issued, number of SERPs displayed and number of SERP clicks, suggesting these are potentially better indicators of frustration rather than engagement. When presented with poor quality results, participants had significantly higher heart rates than when presented with normal quality results. Finally, participants had lower heart rates and greater skin conductance responses when conducting interesting tasks than when conducting uninteresting tasks. This research provides insight into the differences in search behaviors and physiologies of participants when they are engaged versus frustrated and presents techniques that can be used by those wishing to induce engagement and frustration during laboratory IIR studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Edwards","given":"Ashlee"},{"family":"Kelly","given":"Diane"}],"citation-key":"edwardsEngagedFrustratedDisambiguating2017","collection-title":"SIGIR '17","container-title":"Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval","DOI":"10.1145/3077136.3080818","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-5022-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,7]]},"page":"125–134","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Engaged or Frustrated?

The emphasis is on the affective character of ME, which has received little attention in the past. Unlike online task-speciﬁc knowledge, which is conscious and analytic, the other ME are products of nonconscious, nonanalytic inferential processes. Because of their nature, ME can trigger either rapid, nonconscious control decisions or conscious analytic ones. However, ME can make use of both the affective and the cognitive regulatory loops, and this has a series of implications for learning. Evidence is presented regarding the relations of ME with affect and cognition, and the implications of the lack of accuracy of ME for the self-regulation of learning. Particular emphasis is given on judgment of learning, feeling of difﬁculty, and feeling of conﬁdence.

Music is recognized to be an art form that elicits strong emotional responses in listeners and it is therefore pertinent to study empirically how aesthetic judgments relate to emotional responses to music listening. The aim of the presented study is to test for the impact of aesthetic judgment on various psychophysiological response measures of emotion that were assessed in parallel in two contemporary music concerts, each with a different audience and program. In order to induce different levels of aesthetic judgments in participants, we assigned them randomly to one of two groups in a between-subjects design in both concerts: One group attended a talk on the music presented, illustrating its aesthetic value, while the other group attended an unrelated talk on a non-musical topic. During the concerts, we assessed, from 41 participants in Concert 1 (10 males; mean age 23 years) and 53 in Concert 2 (14 males; mean age 24 years), different emotional response components: (a) retrospective rating of emotion; (b) activation of the peripheral nervous system (skin conductance and heart rate); (c) the activity of two facial muscles associated with emotional valence (only Concert 1). Participants listened to live performances of a selection of contemporary music pieces. After each piece, participants rated the music according to a list of commonly discussed aesthetic judgment criteria, all thought to contribute to the perceived aesthetic value of art. While preconcert talks did not signiﬁcantly impact value judgment ratings, through factor analyses it was found that aesthetic judgments could be grouped into several underlying dimensions representing analytical, semantic, traditional aesthetic, and typicality values. All dimensions where then subsequently shown to be related to subjective and physiological responses to music. The ﬁndings reported in this study contribute to understanding the relationship between aesthetic judgment processes and emotional responses to music. The results give further evidence that cognitive-affective interactions have a signiﬁcant role in processing music stimuli.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Egermann","given":"Hauke"},{"family":"Reuben","given":"Federico"}],"citation-key":"egermannBeautyHowYou2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

On each trial, participants read a garden path sentence (e.g., While the storm blew the boat sat in the shed), and, afterwards, they answered a comprehension question (e.g., Did the storm blow the boat?). The design was 2 × 2 (verb type × ambiguity) repeated measures. Verb type was optionally transitive or reflexive, and sentences were ambiguous or unambiguous. Results showed no differences in first pass reading times at the disambiguating verb (e.g., sat). However, regressions did show a significant interaction. The unambiguous-reflexive condition had approximately half the number of regressions, suggesting less processing difficulty in this condition. Developmentally, we found that adolescents had significantly better comprehension, which seemed to be linked to the increased tendency to regress from the disambiguating word.

A dynamical, component systems theory of emotions is presented as a promising framework to further unravel these complex interrelations. This framework considers emotions to be a process that is composed of cognitive, neurophysiological, motor expression, and motivational processes—as well as feelings—that mutually regulate each other over time and within a particular context. This comprehensive view of emotions provides a more complete understanding of the social and dynamical nature of emotions and the integration of emotions within learning processes. Using a dynamical, component systems view of emotional processes, interrelated with learning processes, involves a shift in research methodologies and instruments to adequately investigate the role(s) of emotions within learning contexts. But more importantly, it may provide a powerful framework that can clearly show teachers and parents the role(s) that emotions play in students’ acquisition of knowledge and skills.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Eynde","given":"Peter Op ’T"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Jeannine E."}],"citation-key":"eyndeFocusingComplexityEmotion2006","container-title":"Educational Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Educ Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1007/s10648-006-9031-2","ISSN":"1040-726X, 1573-336X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",11,30]]},"language":"en","page":"361-376","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Focusing on the Complexity of Emotion Issues in Academic Learning: A Dynamical Component Systems Approach","title-short":"Focusing on the Complexity of Emotion Issues in Academic Learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10648-006-9031-2","volume":"18"},{"id":"faulGPowerFlexibleStatistical2007","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Faul","given":"Franz"},{"family":"Erdfelder","given":"Edgar"},{"family":"Lang","given":"Albert-Georg"},{"family":"Buchner","given":"Axel"}],"citation-key":"faulGPowerFlexibleStatistical2007","container-title":"Behavior Research Methods","container-title-short":"Behavior Research Methods","DOI":"10.3758/BF03193146","ISSN":"1554-351X, 1554-3528","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",5]]},"language":"en","license":"http://www.springer.com/tdm","page":"175-191","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"G*Power 3: A flexible statistical power analysis program for the social, behavioral, and biomedical sciences","title-short":"G*Power 3","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.3758/BF03193146","volume":"39"},{"id":"faynAestheticEmotionsAesthetic2015","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Fayn","given":"Kirill"},{"family":"MacCann","given":"Carolyn"},{"family":"Tiliopoulos","given":"Niko"},{"family":"Silvia","given":"Paul J."}],"citation-key":"faynAestheticEmotionsAesthetic2015","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

This framework predicts that global tuning and local parameter adjustments (e.g., position, velocity or phase) can operate independently during coordination (Marmelat & Delignières, 2012). Alternatively, we propose that complexity matching is a result of local phase adjustments during coordination (Delignières & Marmelat, 2014; Torre, Varlet, & Marmelat, 2013). The current study examined this relationship in a rhythmic interpersonal coordination task. Dyads coordinated swinging pendulums that differed in their uncoupled frequencies (detuning). We predicted that frequency detuning would require increased local corrections to maintain the intended phase pattern (in phase). This was expected to yield a relative phase shift accompanied by a change in period complexity and matching. Experimental data and numerical modeling of the pendulum dynamics confirmed our predictions. Increased relative phase shifts occurred simultaneously with increased dissociation between individuals’ movement period complexity. This provided evidence that global complexity matching is intricately linked to local movement adjustments and is not a distinct coordination mechanism. These findings are considered with respect to dynamical and computational approaches to interpersonal coordination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Fine","given":"Justin M."},{"family":"Likens","given":"Aaron D."},{"family":"Amazeen","given":"Eric L."},{"family":"Amazeen","given":"Polemnia G."}],"citation-key":"fineEmergentComplexityMatching2015","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance","DOI":"10.1037/xhp0000046","ISSN":"1939-1277, 0096-1523","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"723-737","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Emergent complexity matching in interpersonal coordination: Local dynamics and global variability.","title-short":"Emergent complexity matching in interpersonal coordination","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/xhp0000046","volume":"41"},{"id":"fingelkurtsMAKINGCOMPLEXITYSIMPLER2004","abstract":"This article provides a retrospective, current, and prospective overview on developments in brain research and neuroscience.

Animals in this phylum lack any centralized brain and instead possess diffuse neural networks known as nerve nets. The learning abilities of these animals are of particular interest as, within the bilaterian clade, they are close evolutionary neighbors to chordates, a phylum whose members exhibit complex feats in learning and contain highly specialized brains. The learning capacities and limitations of echinoderms can inform the evolution of nervous systems and learning in Bilateria. We find evidence of both non-associative and associative learning (in the form of classical conditioning) in echinoderms, which was primarily focused on starfish. Additional evidence of learning is documented in brittle stars, sand dollars, and sea urchins. We then discuss the evolutionary significance of learning capabilities without a brain, the presence of embodied cognition across multiple groups, and compare the learning present in echinoderms with the impressive cognitive abilities documented in the oldest linage group within vertebrates (the major group within the phylum of chordates), fish.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Freas","given":"Cody A"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Ken"}],"citation-key":"freasNeuroecologyBrainLearning2022","container-title":"Learning & Behavior","container-title-short":"Learn Behav","DOI":"10.3758/s13420-021-00492-3","ISSN":"1543-4494, 1543-4508","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"language":"en","page":"20-36","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neuroecology beyond the brain: learning in Echinodermata","title-short":"Neuroecology beyond the brain","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.3758/s13420-021-00492-3","volume":"50"},{"id":"freijeMultifractalDetrendedFluctuation2018","abstract":"In this contribution, we perform detrended ﬂuctuation analysis on eye movement data obtained using an eye tracker with different experimentation subjects performing a set of distinct cognitive tasks.

A new wave of computational models of orthographic processing that offer various forms of noisy position or context-sensitive coding, have revolutionized the field of visual word recognition. The influx of such models stems mainly from consistent findings, coming mostly from European languages, regarding an apparent insensitivity of skilled readers to letter-order. Underlying the current revolution is the theoretical assumption that the insensitivity of readers to letter order reflects the special way in which the human brain encodes the position of letters in printed words. The present paper discusses the theoretical shortcomings and misconceptions of this approach to visual word recognition. A systematic review of data obtained from a variety of languages demonstrates that letter-order insensitivity is not a general property of the cognitive system, neither it is a property of the brain in encoding letters. Rather, it is a variant and idiosyncratic characteristic of some languages, mostly European, reflecting a strategy of optimizing encoding resources, given the specific structure of words. Since the main goal of reading research is to develop theories that describe the fundamental and invariant phenomena of reading across orthographies, an alternative approach to model visual word recognition is offered. The dimensions of a possible universal model of reading, which outlines the common cognitive operations involved in orthographic processing in all writing systems, are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Frost","given":"Ram"}],"citation-key":"frostUniversalModelReading2012","container-title":"The Behavioral and brain sciences","container-title-short":"Behav Brain Sci","DOI":"10.1017/S0140525X11001841","ISSN":"0140-525X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",10]]},"page":"263-279","PMCID":"PMC3677812","PMID":"22929057","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Towards a Universal Model of Reading","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3677812/","volume":"35"},{"id":"fuchsCoordinationDynamicsSynergetics2018","abstract":"Starting with a brief review of the original Haken-Kelso-Bunz model and its generalizations from the 1980s, we discuss three examples from more than three decades of our research on coordination dynamics.

Motion and emotion are thus intrinsically connected: one is moved by movement (perception; impression; affection2) and moved to move (action; expression; e-motion). Through its resonance, the body functions as a medium of emotional perception: it colors or charges self-experience and the environment with affective valences while it remains itself in the background of one’s own awareness. This model is then applied to emotional social understanding or interaffectivity which is regarded as an intertwinement of two cycles of embodied affectivity, thus continuously modifying each partner’s affective affordances and bodily resonance.

This two-part experiment examined dyadic interactions as they occurred between same-sex strangers (Study 1) and friends (Study 2). Participants were video-recorded as they engaged in 5- or 6-min chats, and synchrony was evaluated using wavelet transform via calculations of cross-wavelet coherence. Study 1 employed regression commonality analysis and hierarchical linear modeling and found that among various frequency bands, rapport between individuals was positively associated with synchrony under 0.025 Hz (i.e., slower than once every 40 s) and 0.5–1.5 Hz (i.e., once every 0.67–2 s). On the contrary, Study 2 determined that synchrony of 0.5–1.5 Hz was not impactful among friend dyads and only predictive of the motivation to cultivate a friendly relationship during interactions with strangers. These results indicate the existence of a distinctive rhythm for bonding individuals, and the role of pre-existing friendship as a moderator of the bonding effect of synchrony. However, the role of relative phase (i.e., timing of movement; same versus opposite timing) remains unclear, as the ratio of in- and anti-phase patterning had no significant influence on perceived rapport and motivation to develop relationships.

The current article posits that a stimulant ban for athletes with ADHD does not necessarily facilitate fair play, ensure safety, or align with existing policies of large governing bodies. Instead, we recommend that stimulant medication be allowed in high-level sport, following proper diagnosis by a trained professional and a cardiac assessment to conﬁrm no underlying heart conditions. Athletes with ADHD approved to use stimulant medication should be monitored by a health care professional, physically reevaluated and reassessed for ADHD as clinically appropriate and as indicated by relevant sports governing bodies.

Previous studies have revealed that angry faces induced significant reductions in body sway as compared with neutral and happy faces, reflecting an avoidance behavioral tendency as freezing. The expression of pain is usually considered an unpleasant stimulus, but also a relevant cue for delivering effective care and social support. Nevertheless, there are few data about behavioral dispositions elicited by the observation of pain expressions in others. The aim of the present research was to evaluate approach–avoidance tendencies by using video recordings of postural body sway when participants were standing and observing facial expressions of pain, happy and neutral. We hypothesized that although pain faces would be rated as more unpleasant than the other faces, they would provoke significant changes in postural body sway as compared to neutral facial expressions. Forty healthy female volunteers (mean age 25) participated in the study. Amplitude of forward movements and backward movements in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes were obtained. Statistical analyses revealed that pain faces were the most unpleasant stimuli, and that both happy and pain faces were more arousing than neutral ones. Happy and pain faces also elicited greater amplitude of body sway in the anterior-posterior axes as compared with neutral faces. In addition, significant positive correlations were found between body sway elicited by pain faces and pleasantness and empathic ratings, suggesting that changes in postural body sway elicited by pain faces might be associated with approach and cooperative behavioral responses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Gea","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Muñoz","given":"Miguel A."},{"family":"Costa","given":"Isis"},{"family":"Ciria","given":"Luís F."},{"family":"Miranda","given":"José G.

The ‘Interactional Heterogeneity Hypothesis’ of ASD proposes that the degree to which individuals share a common ground substantially influences their ability to achieve smooth social interactions.\nMethods: To test this hypothesis, we filmed 29 autistic and 29 matched typically developed adults engaged in several conversational tasks. Windowed cross-lagged correlations were computed using the time series of motion energy of both individuals in a dyad. These coefficients were then compared across the three dyad types that were homo- or heterogenous with respect to diagnosis: pairs of two autistic individuals, two typically developed individuals or pairs of one autistic and one typically developed person.\nResults: We found that all dyad types achieved above-chance interpersonal synchrony, but that synchrony was more expressed in typical dyads compared to both autistic and mixed dyads. Limitations: The method presented here provides only one, albeit objective and robust, approach to explore synchrony. The methodological choices as well as the lack of consideration for other communication modalities may limit our interpretation of the findings. Moreover, the sample size is small with respect to exploring associations between synchrony and various outcome and social skill measures.\nConclusions: The present results do not provide support for the Interactional Heterogeneity Hypothesis given that autistic individuals do not coordinate better when interacting with another autistic individual, compared to when interacting with a typical individual.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Georgescu","given":"A.

In language contexts, action-based comprehension arises from simulating the linguistic content using neural and bodily systems of perception, action, and emotion. Within this framework, a new approach to teaching reading comprehension is described: Teach children how to simulate while reading. The Moved by Reading intervention teaches simulation in two stages. In the first stage, physical manipulation, children manipulate toys to simulate the content of what they are reading. After success in physically manipulating the toys, the children are taught to manipulate the toys in imagination.

How could cognition be smoothly integrated with emotions, with social psychology, with development, with clinical analyses? Around that time, thinkers in linguistics, philosophy, artificial intelligence, biology, and psychology were formulating the idea that just as overt behavior depends on the specifics of the body in action, so might cognition depend on the body. Here we characterize (some would say caricature) the strengths and weaknesses of cognitive psychology of that era, and then we describe what has come to be called embodied cognition: how cognition arises through the dynamic interplay of brain controlling bodily action controlling perception, which changes the brain. We focus on the importance of action and how action shapes perception, the self, and language.

To investigate these alternatives, we manipulated gesturing during a math lesson.

Participants (N = 66) were randomly assigned to clinician and patient roles and were grouped into C-P dyads. Clinicians administered painful stimuli to patients as an analogue of a painful medical procedure. We manipulated the perceived C-P similarity of each dyad using groups ostensibly based on shared beliefs and values, and each patient was tested twice: Once with a same group clinician (concordant, CC) and once with a clinician from the other group (discordant, DC). Movement synchrony was calculated as a marker of nonverbal communication. We tested whether movement synchrony mediated the effects of group concordance on patients’ pain and trust in the clinician. Movement synchrony was higher in CC than DC dyads. Higher movement synchrony predicted reduced pain and increased trust in the clinician. Movement synchrony also formally mediated the group concordance effects on pain and trust.

In manual pointing, end‐effector consistency is characterized by the end position of the index fingertip, whereas flexibility in movement execution is captured by the use of abundant arm‐joint configurations not affecting the index finger end position. Because adults have been shown to exploit their system's flexibility in challenging conditions, we wondered whether during middle childhood children are already able to exploit motor flexibility when demanded by the situation. We had children aged 5–10 years and adults perform pointing movements in a nonchallenging and challenging condition. Results showed that end‐effector errors and flexibility in movement execution decreased with age. Importantly, only the 9‐10year‐olds and adults showed increased flexibility in the challenging condition. Thus, while consistency increases and flexibility decreases during mid‐childhood development, from the age of nine children appear able to employ more flexibility with increasing task demands.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Golenia","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Schoemaker","given":"Marina M."},{"family":"Otten","given":"Egbert"},{"family":"Tuitert","given":"Inge"},{"family":"Bongers","given":"Raoul M."}],"citation-key":"goleniaDevelopmentConsistencyFlexibility2018","container-title":"Developmental Psychobiology","container-title-short":"Developmental Psychobiology","DOI":"10.1002/dev.21741","ISSN":"00121630","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7]]},"language":"en","page":"511-519","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The development of consistency and flexibility in manual pointing during middle childhood","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.21741","volume":"60"},{"id":"goleniaDevelopmentReachingMidchildhood2018","abstract":"Inspired by the Developmental Systems perspective, we studied the development of reaching during mid-childhood (5–10 years of age) not just at the performance level (i.e., endpoint movements), as commonly done in earlier studies, but also at the joint angle level. Because the endpoint position (i.e., the tip of the index finger) at the reaching target can be achieved with multiple joint angle combinations, we partitioned variability in joint angles over trials into variability that does not (goal-equivalent variability, GEV) and that does (non-goal-equivalent variability, NGEV) influence the endpoint position, using the Uncontrolled Manifold method. Quantifying this structure in joint angle variability allowed us to examine whether and how spatial variability of the endpoint at the reaching target is related to variability in joint angles and how this changes over development. 6-, 8- and 10-year-old children and young adults performed reaching movements to a target with the index finger. Polynomial trend analysis revealed a linear and a quadratic decreasing trend for the variable error. Linear decreasing and cubic trends were found for joint angle standard deviations at movement end. GEV and NGEV decreased gradually with age, but interestingly, the decrease of GEV was steeper than the decrease of NGEV, showing that the different parts of the joint angle variability changed differently over age. We interpreted these changes in the structure of variability as indicating changes over age in exploration for synergies (a family of task solutions), a concept that links the performance level with the joint angle level.

The pair of pliers was attached to the thumb and the index finger so that the tip of the thumb and the tip of the index finger were displaced to the beaks of the pair of pliers. The grasp component was manipulated by varying the location of the hinge of the pair of pliers, which resulted in different relations between beak opening and closing and finger opening and closing. The Wider Beak group had the hinge at 7 cm, the Same Beak group had the hinge at 10 cm (i.e., in the middle), and the Smaller Beak group had the hinge at 13 cm from the digits. Each group consisted of ten righthanded participants who picked up an object with one of the pairs of pliers 200 times on two subsequent days. Hand opening, plateau phase, hand closing, grasping time and maximum aperture were analyzed. To characterize individual changes over practice time, a log function was fitted on these dependent variables and the ratio of improvement was determined. Results showed that at the beginning stage of tool use learning the characteristic grasping profile consisted of three phases; hand opening, plateau phase and hand closing.

In this perspective, we use the example of mid-childhood (6- to 10-years of age) reaching to show how using the DSA can advance the understanding of development. Mid-childhood is an important developmental period that has often been overshadowed by the focus on the acquisition of reaching during infancy. This underrepresentation of mid-childhood studies is unjustiﬁed, as earlier studies showed that important developmental changes in mid-childhood reaching occur that reﬁne the skill of reaching. We review these studies here for the ﬁrst time and show that different studies revealed different developmental trends, such as non-monotonic and linear trends, for variables such as movement time and accuracy at target. Unfortunately, proposed explanations for these developmental changes have been tailored to individual studies, limiting their scope. Also, explanations were focused on a single component or process in the system that supposedly causes developmental changes. Here, we propose that the DSA can offer an overarching explanation for developmental changes in this research ﬁeld. According to the DSA, motor behavior emerges from interactions of multiple components entailed by the person, environment, and task. Changes in all these components can potentially contribute to the emerging behavior. We show how the principles of change of the DSA can be used as an overarching framework by applying these principles not only to development, but also the behavior itself. This underlines its applicability to other ﬁelds of development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Golenia","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Schoemaker","given":"Marina M."},{"family":"Otten","given":"Egbert"},{"family":"Mouton","given":"Leonora J."},{"family":"Bongers","given":"Raoul M."}],"citation-key":"goleniaWhatDynamicSystems2017","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

However, synchrony is known to take on a dynamical form with continuous shifts in its timeline. Acting as one continuously, is not always the optimal state, due to an intrinsic tension between individualistic and synergistic forms of action that exist in many social situations. We propose an alternative theory of flexible multimodal synchrony which highlights context as a key component that defines “pulls” toward synchrony and “pulls” toward segregation inherent to the social situation. Trait-like individual differences then sensitize individuals to these contextual “pulls”. In this manner, context and individual differences provide the backdrop to the emergence of flexible and dynamical synchrony patterns, which we consider adaptive, in several modalities– behavioral, physiological, and neural. We point to two main interpersonal consequences of multimodal synchrony patterns: Social and task-oriented outcomes. We delineate hypotheses that emanate from the theory which have not been articulated by previous theories and provide two empirical proofs-of-concept: In the first, we show how individual differences modulate the effect of context on synchrony’s outcomes in a novel dyadic motor game. In the second, we re-analyze previously reported data, to show how a ‘flexibility’ data-analysis approach to synchrony improves predictive ability when testing for synchrony’s effects on social cohesion.

Team coordination was observed in three-person uninhabited air vehicle teams across two experimental sessions. The dynamics of the order parameter were observed under changes of a team familiarity control parameter. Team members returned for the second session to either the same (Intact) or different (Mixed) team. “Roadblock” perturbations, or novel changes in the task environment, were introduced in order to probe the stability of team coordination. Nonlinear dynamic methods revealed differences that a traditional approach did not: Intact and Mixed team coordination dynamics looked very different; Mixed teams were more stable than Intact teams and explored the space of solutions without the need for correction. Stability was positively correlated with the number of roadblock perturbations that were overcome successfully. The novel and non-intuitive contribution of a dynamical analysis was that Mixed teams, who did not have a long history working together, were more adaptive.

The authors advance a system typology for classifying TCD approaches and their applications for increasing levels of dynamic complexity.\nBackground: There is an increasing focus on how teams adapt their coordination in response to changing and uncertain operational conditions. Understanding coordination is signiﬁcant because poor coordination is associated with maladaptive responses, whereas adaptive coordination is associated with effective responses. This issue has been met with TCD approaches that handle increasing complexity in the types of TCD teams exhibit.\nMethod: A three-level system typology of TCD approaches for increasing dynamic complexity is provided, with examples of research at each level. For System I TCD, team states converge toward a stable, ﬁxed-point attractor. For System II TCD, team states are periodic, which can appear complex, yet are regular and relatively stable. In System III TCD, teams can exhibit periodic patterns, but those patterns change continuously to maintain effectiveness.\nResults: System I and System II are applicable to TCD with known or discoverable behavioral attractors that are stationary across mid-to long-range timescales. System III TCD is the most generalizable to dynamic environments with high requirements for adaptive coordination across a range of timescales.\nConclusion: We outline current challenges for TCD and next steps in this burgeoning ﬁeld of research. Application: System III approaches are becoming widespread, as they are generalizable to time- and/or scale-varying TCD and multimodal analyses.

To date, only a few psychopathology relevant studies have systematically quantiﬁed HRV-HF proﬁles using more ecologically valid methods in everyday life. Using an experience-sampling approach, the present study examined both mean levels and intra-individual variability of HRV-HF – as well as comparison measures of cardiovascular arousal, sympathetic activity, and gross somatic movement – in everyday life, using ambulatory psychophysiological measurement across a six-day consecutive period among a spectrum of community adult participants with varying degrees of positive valence system disturbance, including adults with bipolar I disorder (BD; n = 21), major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 17), and healthy non-psychiatric controls (CTL; n = 28). Groups did not differ in mean HRV-HF, but greater HRVHF instability (i.e., intra-individual variation in HRV-HF) was found in the BD compared to both MDD and CTL groups. Subsequent analyses suggested that group differences in HRV-HF variability were largely accounted for by variations in clinician-rated manic symptoms. However, no association was found between HRV-HF variability and dimensional measures of positive affectivity. This work provides evidence consistent with a quadratic relationship between HRV-HF and positive emotional disturbance and represents a valuable step toward developing a more ecologically valid model of positive valence system disturbances and their underlying psychophysiological mechanisms within an RDoC framework.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Gruber","given":"June"},{"family":"Mennin","given":"Douglas S."},{"family":"Fields","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Purcell","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Murray","given":"Greg"}],"citation-key":"gruberHeartRateVariability2015","container-title":"International Journal of Psychophysiology","container-title-short":"International Journal of Psychophysiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2015.08.005","ISSN":"01678760","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11]]},"language":"en","page":"240-248","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Heart rate variability as a potential indicator of positive valence system disturbance: A proof of concept investigation","title-short":"Heart rate variability as a potential indicator of positive valence system disturbance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167876015300210","volume":"98"},{"id":"gullettHeartRateVariability2023","abstract":"Evidence suggests affective disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder are characterised by dysregulated autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. These findings suggest ANS dysregulation may be involved in the pathogenesis of affective disorders. Different affective states are characterised by different ANS activity patterns (i.e., an increase or decrease in sympathetic or parasympathetic activity). To understand how ANS abnormalities are involved in the development of affective disorders, it is important to understand how affective states correlate with ANS activity before their onset. Using heart rate variability (HRV) as a tool to measure ANS activity, this review aimed to look at associations between affective states and HRV in non-clinical populations (i.e., in those without medical and psychiatric disorders). Searches on PubMed and Google Scholar were completed using the following search terms: heart rate variability, autonomic nervous system, sympathetic nervous system, para­ sympathetic nervous system, affective state, mood and emotion in all possible combinations. All but one of the studies examined (N = 13), demonstrated significant associations between affect and HRV. Findings suggest negative affect, encompassing both diffused longer-term experiences (i.e., mood) as well as more focused shortterm experiences (i.e., emotions), may be associated with a reduction in parasympathetic activity as measured through HRV parameters known to quantify parasympathetic activity (e.g., high frequency (HF)-HRV). HRV measures typically linked to reduction in parasympathetic activity appear to be linked to negative affective states in non-clinical populations. However, given the complex and possibly non-linear relationship between HRV and parasympathetic activity, further studies need to clarify specificity of these findings. Future studies should investigate the potential utility of HRV measures as biomarkers for monitoring changes in affective states and for early detection of onset and relapse of depression in patients with affective disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Gullett","given":"Nancy"},{"family":"Zajkowska","given":"Zuzanna"},{"family":"Walsh","given":"Annabel"},{"family":"Harper","given":"Ross"},{"family":"Mondelli","given":"Valeria"}],"citation-key":"gullettHeartRateVariability2023","container-title":"International Journal of Psychophysiology","container-title-short":"International Journal of Psychophysiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2023.08.001","ISSN":"01678760","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10]]},"language":"en","page":"35-42","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Heart rate variability (HRV) as a way to understand associations between the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and affective states: A critical review of the literature","title-short":"Heart rate variability (HRV) as a way to understand associations between the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and affective states","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167876023004853","volume":"192"},{"id":"haddadDevelopmentalChangesDynamical2008","abstract":"Recent research using measures to assess the time-dependent structure of postural fluctuations has provided new insights into the stability and adaptability of human postural control in adults. To date, little research has examined how postural dynamics reflecting the stability and adaptability of postural control may change as a function of development, especially during supra-postural tasks. The goal of this study was to examine the dynamics of postural fluctuations during a manual-fitting task in which precision, visual and postural task constraints were altered in children and adults. Three age groups were tested: 7-, 10-year olds and college aged adults. Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) was used to assess the regularity (percent determinism) and complexity (entropy) of the center of pressure (CoP) in the anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions. The CoP patterns exhibited by adults were more deterministic and more complex (higher entropy) than those of the 7-year-old children under the different experimental manipulations. No differences between the adults and the 10-year-old children were observed. The increase in determinism with a corresponding increase in entropy exhibited by the adults and older-children during a manual fitting task may be a prospective mechanism over which postural movements follow a more predictable path allowing for stable and flexible task performance. Our results also support the notion that complex postural fluctuations (as measured by RQA entropy) are functional and typically increase as the precision requirements of a manual task increase.","author":[{"family":"Haddad","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Emmerik","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Wheat","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Hamill","given":"Joseph"}],"citation-key":"haddadDevelopmentalChangesDynamical2008","container-title":"Experimental brain research.

Art materials differ in ﬂuidity and are postulated to thus differentially enhance emotional response (the more ﬂuid the material the more emotion elicited). Yet, to the best of our knowledge, this assumption has not been empirically tested. The current study aimed to examine the emotional and physiological responses to art-making with different art materials. We were particularly interested in vagal activity, indexed by heart rate variability (HRV), because of its association with numerous health related outcomes. In this study, 50 adults (mean age 33 ± 10.27 years, 52% males) participated in a repeated measures experiment, in which they were requested to draw with three art materials (order randomized) differing in their level of ﬂuidity (pencil, oil-pastels, and gouache paint) intermittent with periods of music. We measured the emotional response to art-making with each material using a self-report measure and matrices of HRV using a wearable electrocardiogram device. We calculated two indices of HRV, one indicative of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity, and one indicative of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. Art-making with gouache paint and oil-pastels resulted in improved positive mood, while pencil did not. Art-making explained approximately 35% of the variability in parasympathetic reactivity, which may indicate changes in emotional regulation processes during the art-making task. Yet, ﬂuidity was not sufﬁcient to explain the reaction to art-making. Surprisingly, the largest suppression of PNS and augmentation of the SNS occurred during art-making with oil-pastels and not with Gouache. Moreover, PNS and SNS reactivity to oil-pastels were related to emotional valance, which may point to emotional engagement. We can conclude that art-making with oil-pastels, ﬁrst created in Japan in 1924 to increase self-expression of students, results in a unique emotional and physiological responses. These ﬁndings might be explained by the enhanced tactile experience of art-making with oil-pastels along with their relative ﬂuidity, triggering an arousal pattern. Further studies that take the format and presentation of the materials as well as the content of the artwork, into account, are needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Haiblum-Itskovitch","given":"Shai"},{"family":"Czamanski-Cohen","given":"Johanna"},{"family":"Galili","given":"Giora"}],"citation-key":"haiblum-itskovitchEmotionalResponseChanges2018","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

Building on this principle, the neuroscience literature has employed markers of metastability to investigate various aspects of brain function including cognitive performance, healthy ageing, meditation, sleep, responses to pharmacological challenges, and to characterise psychiatric conditions or disorders of consciousness. However, this body of work often uses the notion of metastability heuristically, and sometimes inaccurately, making it hard for the uninitiated to navigate the vast literature, interpret findings, and foster further development of theoretical and experimental methodologies. In this paper we provide a comprehensive review of metastability and its applications in neuroscience, covering its scientific and historical foundations and the practical estimators used to estimate it in empirical data.

We propose that an answer to this question must take into account the feeling of being moved, a complex emotional state that plays a major role in the history of poetics and aesthetics and has recently begun to attract interest in psychological research. We conducted a study in an actual cinema using film clips as sadness-eliciting stimuli. In total, 76 participants watched 38 clips that presented variations of the same sad scenario: a character or a group of characters learns about the death of a close person. The study revealed a highly significant positive correlation between sadness and enjoyment. However, this correlation was almost fully mediated by the feeling of being moved. Hence sadness primarily functions as a contributor to and intensifier of the emotional state of being moved. Furthermore, the study revealed that being moved is a positive term in two senses. First, it refers to an overall positive feeling. Second, it indicates a positive value judgment regarding the power of a film to elicit such feelings. Therefore, we conclude that it is the overall positive feeling of being moved itself that recipients of sad films and other forms of art enjoy—we simply like to be moved. Taken together, our findings are significant for investigations of the so-called ‘sad-film paradox’ and the aesthetic pleasure associated with negative emotions more generally.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hanich","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Wagner","given":"Valentin"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Mira"},{"family":"Jacobsen","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Menninghaus","given":"Winfried"}],"citation-key":"hanichWhyWeWatch2014","container-title":"Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts","container-title-short":"Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts","DOI":"10.1037/a0035690","ISSN":"1931-390X, 1931-3896","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",5]]},"language":"en","page":"130-143","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Why we like to watch sad films.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diverging claims about the specific deficient peceptual processes under conditions of strong inference. Theoretically relevant acoustic features were extracted from a set of artificial speech stimuli that lie on a /bAk/-/dAk/ continuum. The features were tested on their ability to enable a simple classifier (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis) to reproduce the observed classification performance of average and dyslexic readers in a speech perception experiment. The ‘classical’ features examined were based on component process accounts of developmental dyslexia such as the supposed deficit in Envelope Rise Time detection and the deficit in the detection of rapid changes in the distribution of energy in the frequency spectrum (formant transitions). Studies examining these temporal processing deficit hypotheses do not employ measures that quantify the temporal dynamics of stimuli. It is shown that measures based on quantification of the dynamics of complex, interaction-dominant systems (Recurrence Quantification Analysis and the multifractal spectrum) enable QDA to classify the stimuli almost identically as observed in dyslexic and average reading participants. It seems unlikely that participants used any of the features that are traditionally associated with accounts of (impaired) speech perception. The nature of the variables quantifying the temporal dynamics of the speech stimuli imply that the classification of speech stimuli cannot be regarded as a linear aggregate of component processes that each parse the acoustic signal independent of one another, as is assumed by the ‘classical’ aetiologies of developmental dyslexia. It is suggested that the results imply that the differences in speech perception performance between average and dyslexic readers represent a scaled continuum rather than being caused by a specific deficient component.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Hasselman","given":"Fred"}],"citation-key":"hasselmanClassifyingAcousticSignals2015","container-title":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.837","ISSN":"2167-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,26]]},"language":"en","page":"e837","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Classifying acoustic signals into phoneme categories: average and dyslexic readers make use of complex dynamical patterns and multifractal scaling properties of the speech signal","title-short":"Classifying acoustic signals into phoneme categories","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/837","volume":"3"},{"id":"hasselmanGeometrySynchronizationQuantifying2023","abstract":"In the study of synchronization dynamics between interacting systems, several techniques are available to estimate coupling strength and coupling direction. Currently, there is no general ‘best’ method that will perform well in most contexts. Inter-system recurrence networks (IRN) combine auto-recurrence and cross-recurrence matrices to create a graph that represents interacting networks. The method is appealing because it is based on cross-recurrence quantification analysis, a well-developed method for studying synchronization between 2 systems, which can be expanded in the IRN framework to include N &gt; 2 interacting networks. In this study we examine whether IRN can be used to analyze coupling dynamics between physiological variables (acceleration, blood volume pressure, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature) observed in a client in residential care with severe to profound intellectual disabilities (SPID) and their professional caregiver. Based on the cross-clustering coefficients of the IRN conclusions about the coupling direction (client or caregiver drives the interaction) can be drawn, however, deciding between bi-directional coupling or no coupling remains a challenge. Constructing the full IRN, based on the multivariate time series of five coupled processes, reveals the existence of potential feedback loops. Further study is needed to be able to determine dynamics of coupling between the different layers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Hasselman","given":"Fred"},{"family":"Den Uil","given":"Luciënne"},{"family":"Koordeman","given":"Renske"},{"family":"De Looff","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Otten","given":"Roy"}],"citation-key":"hasselmanGeometrySynchronizationQuantifying2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Network Physiology","container-title-short":"Front.

In the present paper, I argue that an ontological commitment to complex adaptive systems is not only possible, but highly recommended for the study of resilience in development. Such a commitment, however, also comes with a commitment to a different causal ontology and different research methods. In the first part of the paper, I discuss the extent to which current research on resilience in development conceptually adheres to the complex systems perspective. In the second part, I introduce conceptual tools that may help researchers conceptualize causality in complex systems. The third part discusses idiographic methods that could be used in a research program that embraces the interaction dominant causal ontology and idiosyncratic nature of the dynamics of complex systems.

In children of ∼3 yr of age, gait appears relatively mature; however, it is unknown whether the dynamics of walking change beyond this age. Because stride dynamics depend on neural control, we hypothesized that motor control would continue to develop beyond age 3. To test this hypothesis, we measured the gait cycle duration on a stride-by-stride basis in 50 healthy 3- to 14-yr-old children (25 girls). Measurements of stride-to-stride variability were significantly larger both in the 3- and 4-yr-old children, compared with the 6- and 7-yr-old children, and in the 6- and 7-yr-old children, compared with the 11- to 14-yr-old children. Measurements of the temporal organization of gait also revealed significant age-dependent changes. The effects of age persisted even after adjusting for height. These findings indicate that mature stride dynamics may not be completely developed even in healthy 7-yr-old children and that different aspects of stride dynamics mature at different ages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hausdorff","given":"J.

Cognitive film theory attributes this to the system of continuity editing, a system of editing guidelines outlining the effect of different cuts and edits on spectators. A major principle in this framework is the 180° rule, a rule recommendation that, to avoid spectators’ attention to the editing, two edited shots of the same event or action should not be filmed from angles differing in a way that expectations of spatial continuity are strongly violated. In the present study, we used high-density EEG to explore the neural underpinnings of this rule. In particular, our analysis shows that cuts and edits in general elicit early ERP component indicating the registration of syntactic violations as known from language, music, and action processing. However, continuity edits and cuts-across the line differ from each other regarding later components likely to be indicating the differences in spatial remapping as well as in the degree of conscious awareness of one's own perception. Interestingly, a time–frequency analysis of the occipital alpha rhythm did not support the hypothesis that such differences in processing routes are mainly linked to visual attention. On the contrary, our study found specific modulations of the central mu rhythm ERD as an indicator of sensorimotor activity, suggesting that sensorimotor networks might play an important role. We think that these findings shed new light on current discussions about the role of attention and embodied perception in film perception and should be considered when explaining spectators’ different experience of different kinds of cuts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Heimann","given":"Katrin S."},{"family":"Uithol","given":"Sebo"},{"family":"Calbi","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Umiltà","given":"Maria A."},{"family":"Guerra","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Gallese","given":"Vittorio"}],"citation-key":"heimannCutsActionHighDensity2017","container-title":"Cognitive Science","DOI":"10.1111/cogs.12439","ISSN":"1551-6709","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"1555-1588","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"“Cuts in Action”: A High-Density EEG Study Investigating the Neural Correlates of Different Editing Techniques in Film","title-short":"“Cuts in Action”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cogs.12439","volume":"41"},{"id":"hennessyStabilityChangeStress2015","abstract":"In mammals, maternal signals conveyed via influences on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity may shape behavior of the young to be better adapted for prevailing environmental conditions. However, the mother’s influence extends beyond classic stress response systems. In guinea pigs, several hours (h) of separation from the mother activates not only the HPA axis, but also the innate immune system, which effects immediate behavioral change, as well as modifies behavioral responsiveness in the future. Moreover, the presence of the mother potently suppresses the behavioral consequences of this innate immune activation. These findings raise the possibility that long-term adaptive behavioral change can be mediated by the mother’s influence on immune-related activity of her pups. Furthermore, the impact of social partners on physiological stress responses and their behavioral outcomes are not limited to the infantile period. A particularly crucial period for social development in male guinea pigs is that surrounding the attainment of sexual maturation. At this time, social interactions with adults can dramatically affect circulating cortisol concentrations and social behavior in ways that appear to prepare the male to best cope in its likely future social environment. Despite such multiple social influences on the behavior of guinea pigs at different ages, inter-individual differences in the magnitude of the cortisol response remain surprisingly stable over most of the life span. Together, it appears that throughout the life span, physiological stress responses may be regulated by social stimuli. These influences are hypothesized to adjust behavior for predicted environmental conditions. In addition, stable individual differences might provide a means of facilitating adaptation to less predictable conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Hennessy","given":"Michael B"},{"family":"Kaiser","given":"Sylvia"},{"family":"Tiedtke","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Sachser","given":"Norbert"}],"citation-key":"hennessyStabilityChangeStress2015","container-title":"Frontiers in Zoology","container-title-short":"Front Zool","DOI":"10.1186/1742-9994-12-S1-S18","ISSN":"1742-9994","issue":"Suppl 1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"S18","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Stability and change: Stress responses and the shaping of behavioral phenotypes over the life span","title-short":"Stability and change","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-9994-12-S1-S18","volume":"12"},{"id":"heras-escribanoPragmatismEnactivismEcological2021","abstract":"This paper argues that it is possible to combine enactivism and ecological psychology in a single post-cognitivist research framework if we highlight the common pragmatist assumptions of both approaches.

It is argued that the idea of behavioral or organic coordination within the enactive approach gives rise to the sensorimotor abilities of the organism, while the ecological approach emphasizes the coordination at a higher-level between organism and environment through the agent’s exploratory behavior for perceiving affordances. As such, these two different processes of organic coordination can be integrated in a postcognitivist research framework, which will be based on two levels of analysis: the subpersonal one (the neural dynamics of the sensorimotor contingencies and the emergence of enactive agency) and the personal one (the dynamics that emerges from the organism-environment interaction in ecological terms).

By the end of practice, participants performed 5:2 consistently and performed 5:3 using more stable ratios (3:2 and 2:1). Lagged return plots revealed that 5:3 learners harnessed the stable inphase and antiphase patterns to stabilize the required ratio. That strategy resulted in the performance of smaller-integer ratios in the production of 5:3 but not 5:2. Despite those differences, there was positive transfer to unpracticed ratios that was similar in both learning conditions. The time series analysis of lagged return plots revealed differences in ratio performance at transfer. Ratios whose component frequencies were farther apart, like 7:2, were performed consistently, while ratios whose component frequencies were more similar, like 5:4, elicited attraction to inphase and antiphase.

Indeed, we respond not only to anticipations per se, but to the relation between anticipations and experiences. Such anticipations operate on different time scales, linked with distinct neurological substrates. Some—such as those involving expectations about the immediate trajectory of objects—are very brief. The relations between experience and very short-term expectations can have significant emotional consequences. One purpose of the standard continuity editing system is to avoid disruptions in our short-term projections.

This paper considers how dancers achieve the movement accuracy demanded by ballet technique within the inherent and essential variability of functioning human body systems and according to the inevitable individuality of each human body. What role do variable biological mechanisms play in the pursuit of this advanced human ability? Using an exemplar analysis of the pirouette, we discuss how the human body’s innate movement variability can be integrated with ballet technique. Awareness of this integration has the potential to inform the pedagogical processes employed by dance educators, thereby focusing dancers’ aspirations towards the integration of their innate movement strategies within ballet technique.

Within the framework of this theory, satisficing sub-optimal behavior is any behavior that does not promote a decrease in the prospective control of the functional action diversity/unpredictability (D/U) potential of the agent or team. This potential is defined as the entropy measure in multiple, context-dependent dimensions. We define the satisficing interval of behaviors as CCI. In order to manifest itself at individual or team level, this capacity harnesses properties such as degeneracy, pleiotropy (pluri-potentiality), synergies, and metastability. Intelligence is embodied because intelligent behavior is deeply dependent on body functionalities, defined as entropy measures. We base our theory on three principles: (a) relativity of functional entropy/ information in agent (team)-environment systems, (b) tendency toward the satisficing level of D/U potential, and (c) tendency toward the non-decreasing D/U potential. The conjunction of these three principles provides existence of sub-optimal behaviors associated with CCI. First, we deal with the problem of how to reduce multidimensional behavior to a concept that accounts for the vast set of scenarios in which CCI is manifested. Secondly, we define and discuss the three interacting principles that underpin CCI behavior as well as providing an outline for a future CCI research program supported by agentbased modeling and empirical research.

Many noisy signals in real systems display trends, so that the scaling results obtained from the DFA method become difficult to analyze. We systematically study the effects of three types of trends -- linear, periodic, and power-law trends, and offer examples where these trends are likely to occur in real data. We compare the difference between the scaling results for artificially generated correlated noise and correlated noise with a trend, and study how trends lead to the appearance of crossovers in the scaling behavior. We find that crossovers result from the competition between the scaling of the noise and the ``apparent'' scaling of the trend. We study how the characteristics of these crossovers depend on (i) the slope of the linear trend; (ii) the amplitude and period of the periodic trend; (iii) the amplitude and power of the power-law trend and (iv) the length as well as the correlation properties of the noise. Surprisingly, we find that the crossovers in the scaling of noisy signals with trends also follow scaling laws -- i.e. long-range power-law dependence of the position of the crossover on the parameters of the trends. We show that the DFA result of noise with a trend can be exactly determined by the superposition of the separate results of the DFA on the noise and on the trend, assuming that the noise and the trend are not correlated. If this superposition rule is not followed, this is an indication that the noise and the superimposed trend are not independent, so that removing the trend could lead to changes in the correlation properties of the noise.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Hu","given":"Kun"},{"family":"Ivanov","given":"Plamen Ch"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhi"},{"family":"Carpena","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Stanley","given":"H.

In the chapter, we will describe what the eye movement methodology has revealed about word recognition, syntactic parsing of sentences, and comprehension of longer segments of text. The typical eye movement pattern in reading is one where the reader makes a sequence of left to right eye movements from one word to the next so that most words are fixated at least once. Words that typically do not receive a fixation are short, high-frequency function words, such as articles and prepositions. Fixation time spent on individual words and larger text units can then be used to tap into the cognitive processes that make reading possible. A wealth of data has been accumulated on using fixation time measures to investigate word recognition processes during reading. These studies have shown that fixation times reliably reflect the underlying mental processes ongoing during fixations on words. It has been shown, among other things, that orthographic, phonological and semantic features all influence the time spent fixating a word. This also applies to developing readers, who differ from mature readers in making more and longer fixations, shorter saccades and more regressions. The differences in eye movement patterns between developing and mature readers are primarily explained by lexical processing efficiency, not by low-level oculomotor factors. Eye movements have also been used to study processing of non-foveal text information. This is referred to as parafoveal word processing. Here the interesting questions are how far to the periphery useful information can be extracted and what kind of information can be gleaned from words around the fixated word. It has been found that the readers’ perceptual span is strongly biased toward the reading direction, that is, to the right when reading from left to right. Developing readers have smaller perceptual span than proficient readers. Adult readers extract parafoveally visual, orthographic and phonological information from the word to the right of the fixated word. Recent evidence suggests that they are also capable of extracting parafoveally semantic information concerning word meanings. Developmental studies of parafoveal word processing are just beginning to accrue. In the study of sentence parsing, that is, assigning a syntactic structure to a sentence, eye-tracking has become the gold standard. Having reliable and sensitive measures of the timing of effects is pertinent in testing predictions derived from different competing theories of sentence parsing. That sentences (and clauses) are regarded as processing units is demonstrated by the sentence wrap-up effect. Readers pause for longer time at sentence-final words before proceeding to the next sentence, presumably in order to integrate the words into a coherent sentence meaning. Eye movement studies of sentence parsing have demonstrated that parsing takes place incrementally as readers proceed through the sentence. Syntactic ambiguity, syntactic complexity and syntactic violations, among other things, have been shown to influence the eye movement patterns during sentence comprehension. Reading texts longer than single sentences has been the least researched area in the study of eye movements during reading. However, with the help of eye fixation measures developed to study global text processing, eye movement studies on text comprehension have recently been gaining increased popularity. To date, eye fixation patterns have been used to study how readers construct and update a mental representation of the text contents. For example, studies have been conducted on how readers solve inconsistencies in text and comprehend ironic statements.

However, these conventional scaling analyses are insensitive to multiplicative interactions within the movement variable. Multiplicative interactions refer to couplings between the scale-dependent variations across multiple scales that generate intermittent changes in the human movement variable. The mathematical concept for intermittent variability generated by multiplicative interactions is called multifractal variability. Multifractal variability is numerically deﬁned by a spectrum of scaling exponents (i.e., a multifractal spectrum) that can be an important feature of coordinated movements and, consequently, relevant when aiming to identify movement disorders. In the current study, a new method is introduced based on detrended ﬂuctuation analysis that can identify the multifractal spectrum from the temporal variation of local scaling exponents. The inﬂuence of multiplicative interactions on the local scaling exponents is tested by a Monte Carlo surrogate test. The methods are validated on multiplicative cascading processes with known multiplicative interactions. The application of the new methods is subsequently illustrated on an example of centre of pressure variations during quiet and relaxed standing. The results show that multiplicative interactions are present during periods with large movements of the center of gravity, where the movements of the centre of gravity and centre of pressure couple into coordinative structures. Further application and interpretation of the developed method for the study of human movement variability are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Ihlen","given":"Espen A.

In this article, we provide quantitative support for such a theory of interaction-dominant dynamics in human cognition by using wavelet-based multifractal analysis and accompanying multiplicative cascading process on the response series of 4 different cognitive tasks: simple response, word naming, choice decision, and interval estimation. Results indicated that the major portion of these response series had multiplicative interactions between temporal scales, visible as intermittent periods of large and irregular fluctuations (i.e., a multifractal structure). Comparing 2 component-dominant models of 1/f ␣ fluctuations in cognitive performance with the multiplicative cascading process indicated that the multifractal structure could not be replicated by these component-dominant models. Furthermore, a similar multifractal structure was shown to be present in a model of self-organized criticality in the human nervous system, similar to a spatial extension of the multiplicative cascading process. These results illustrate that a wavelet-based multifractal analysis and the multiplicative cascading process form an appropriate framework to characterize interaction-dominant dynamics in human cognition. This new framework goes beyond the identification of 1/f ␣ power laws and non-Gaussian distributions in response series as used in previous studies.

Among other things, this has resulted in a debate throughout the last decades about the origin of variability in behavior, the outcome of which has important implications for motor control theories. To date, a monofractal formalism of variability has been used as the basis for arguing for component- versus interaction-oriented theories of motor control. However, monofractal formalism alone cannot decide between the opposing sides of the debate. The present theoretical overview introduces multifractal formalisms as a necessary extension of the conventional monofractal formalism. In multifractal formalisms, the scale invariance of behavior is numerically deﬁned as a spectrum of scaling exponents, rather than a single average exponent as in the monofractal formalism. Several methods to estimate the multifractal spectrum of scaling exponents – all within two multifractal formalisms called large deviation and Legendre formalism – are introduced and brieﬂy discussed. Furthermore, the multifractal analyses within these two formalisms are applied to several performance tasks to illustrate how explanations of motor control vary with the methods used. The main section of the theoretical overview discusses the implications of multifractal extensions of the component- and interaction-oriented models for existing theories of motor control.

Changes in standing balance are measured as subjects process vocabulary words, sentences, and paragraphs with varying degrees of relative difficulty. It is predicted that the more difficult the content, the more subjects will sway.\nAlthough standing itself is a common enough task, the biological requirements of postural control during standing are fairly complex, requiring the involvement of an uninterrupted flow of afferent signals reaching the central nervous system from the muscle, tendon and joint proprioceptors, skin exteroceptors, and vestibular and visual inputs ([Fitzpatrick and McCloskey, 1994]). As such, there are numerous clinical applications in assessing standing balance, as decreasingly stable measured parameters from a standing posture can reflect the increased risk of falls in the elderly ([Maki et al., 1994]), individuals with Parkinson’s Disease ([Błaszczyk et al., 2007]), or patients with multiple sclerosis ([Prosperini and Pozzilli, 2013]). Standing balance is sensitive to psychological perturbations ([Kerr et al., 1985]), and may even be perturbed by language tasks ([Shumway-Cook et al., 1997]), indicating a link between standing and language processing.\nBased on prior literature, this thesis tests the assumption that there is a link between language processing and postural control. If standing control processes are interrupted by the processing of language, then using balance to measure changes in cognitive load could be used to objectively assess linguistic difficulty.\nForce plates are used to measure balance, which are laboratory-grade devices used in Biomechanics and Kinesiology to quantify various physical properties of human movement ([Winter, 2009]), ranging from running or jumping ([Chappell et al., 2005], [McLean et al., 2004]), to the more obscure and less conscious overall motions such as the subtle displacements involved in maintaining a standing upright posture ([Murray et al., 1975]).\nA set of experiments was performed on the auditory processing of three general elements of language: Paragraphs, sentences, and vocabulary words. There are two methods of analysis used, one which tests the overall changes in postural sway, and one which observes changes in postural sway over time. The two parameters used, respectively, are the fiftieth percentile of the radial range of the center of pressure, and the radial distance of the center of pressure over time.\nThe results from the overall changes in postural sway suggest that balance is sensitive to changes in cognitive load due to language processing. For the paragraphs, results suggest that very difficult passages elicit greater changes in postural sway compared to the easier passages. Likewise, in the first of two experiments on sentences, sentences which the literature reports requiring relatively more cognitive load to process exhibit relatively greater changes in postural sway. For the second sentence study, results suggest a correlation between postural sway and the acceptability rankings of four different sentence types, so long as syllable count is accounted for. For the experiment on vocabulary words, increases in postural sway are observed when the difficulty level is increased.\nThe results from the observations of postural sway over time also suggest that balance is sensitive to changes in cognitive load due to language processing. For the paragraphs, the trends of postural sway are different for each of the three difficulty levels tested. For the first of two experiments on sentences, it is shown that the sway is increased in the parts of the sentences where more cognitive load is required. Likewise for the second sentence study, a similar trend in postural sway is found for the regions of time where the sentences should be less acceptable. For vocabulary words, an observable trend is also present, and only a trend exists, implying that a threshold for utilizing postural sway to intuitively measure changes in cognitive load due to language processing is reached in vocabulary words.\nOverall, the results suggest that postural sway is sensitive to changes in cognitive load for paragraphs, sentences, and possibly vocabulary words. An intuitive interpretation of the results can be found for the studies on paragraphs and sentences, where greater amounts of sway is indicative of greater difficulty encountered during language processing. This trend in the data is present, but less apparent, for the study on the vocabulary words, providing some insight into how small the tested elements of language can be in getting an intuitive interpretation of changes in postural sway as it relates to changes in cognitive load during language processing. These results suggest that postural sway can be used as a practical tool for measuring changes in cognitive load during language processing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Jang","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"jangMeasuringChangesCognitive2017","genre":"text","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,29]]},"license":"Copyright 2017 John Jang","publisher":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","source":"www.ideals.illinois.edu","title":"Measuring changes in cognitive load in language processing through measuring postural sway","type":"thesis","URL":"https://hdl.handle.net/2142/99340"},{"id":"jehnConflictContagionTemporal2013","abstract":"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to build theory and present a model of the development of conﬂicts in teams.

We discuss sensing of these kinds in sponges, ctenophores, placozoans, cnidarians and bilaterians. Reafference is ubiquitous, as ongoing action, especially whole-body motility, will almost inevitably influence the senses.

However, increasing evidence indicates that maintaining mental health in the face of adversity results from complex and dynamic processes of adaptation to stressors that involve the activation of several separable protective factors. Such resilience factors can reside at biological, psychological, and social levels and may include stable predispositions (such as genotype or personality traits) and malleable properties, skills, capacities, or external circumstances (such as gene-expression patterns, emotion-regulation abilities, appraisal styles, or social support). We abandon the notion of resilience as an entity here. Starting from a conceptualization of psychiatric disorders as dynamic networks of interacting symptoms that may be driven by stressors into stable maladaptive states of disease, we deconstruct the maintenance of mental health during stressor exposure into timevariant dampening influences of resilience factors onto these symptom networks. Resilience factors are separate additional network nodes that weaken symptom–symptom interconnections or symptom autoconnections, thereby preventing maladaptive system transitions. We argue that these hybrid symptom-and-resilience-factor networks provide a promising new way of unraveling the complex dynamics of mental health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Kalisch","given":"Raffael"},{"family":"Cramer","given":"Angélique O.

This is accompanied by physiological changes such as galvanic skin response (GSR), an indicator for emotional arousal, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), referring to vagal activity. We investigated whether the presence of a cinema audience affects these psychophysiological processes. The study was conducted in a real cinema in Berlin. Participants came twice to watch previously rated emotional film scenes eliciting amusement, anger, tenderness or fear. Once they watched the scenes alone, once in a group. We tested whether the vagal modulation in response to the mere presence of others influences explicit (reported) and implicit markers (RSA, heart rate (HR) and GSR) of emotional processes in function of solitary or collective enjoyment of movie scenes. On the physiological level, we found a mediating effect of vagal flexibility to the mere presence of others. Individuals showing a high baseline difference (alone vs. social) prior to the presentation of film, maintained higher RSA in the alone compared to the social condition. The opposite pattern emerged for low baseline difference individuals. Emotional arousal as reflected in GSR was significantly more pronounced during scenes eliciting anger independent of the social condition. On the behavioural level, we found evidence for emotion-specific effects on reported empathy, emotional intensity and Theory of Mind. Furthermore, people who decrease their RSA in response to others’ company are those who felt themselves more empathically engaged with the characters. Our data speaks in favour of a specific role of vagal regulation in response to the mere presence of others in terms of explicit empathic engagement with characters during shared filmic experience.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Kaltwasser","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Rost","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Ardizzi","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Calbi","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Settembrino","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Fingerhut","given":"Joerg"},{"family":"Pauen","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Gallese","given":"Vittorio"}],"citation-key":"kaltwasserSharingFilmicExperience2019","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0223259","editor":[{"family":"Avenanti","given":"Alessio"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,18]]},"language":"en","page":"e0223259","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sharing the filmic experience - The physiology of socio-emotional processes in the cinema","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0223259","volume":"14"},{"id":"kamphorstTuneMultimodalMotherChild2022","abstract":"A complex dynamic systems perspective was applied to explore how mother and child mutually shape interpersonal coordination. Applying a microanalytic design, this study examined the moment-to-moment interaction behavior of 39 Dutch mothers and their three- and four-yearold children (53.8% girls, predominantly White) during a collaboration task. Fine-grained time-series data were extracted about the verbal, affec­ tive, and body movement modalities. Research Findings: Cross-recurrence quantification analysis showed that mothers and children were coupled within all three modalities. Recurrent behaviors were found with varying delays, spanning from the immediate to the entire length of the interac­ tion. Many of the interactions were characterized by a certain degree of patternedness, whereby the amount of patternedness varied substantially between dyads. Measures of interpersonal coordination were not asso­ ciated between modalities. Practice or Policy: Next to the content of interaction behavior (e.g., what a parent actually says), practitioners should also consider how behaviors of a mother and her child vary together. Thereby, an appraisal of the caregiver–child relationship should not merely focus on caregiving behavior, but acknowledge the active and autonomous involvement of the child. It remains to be investigated how different patterns of interpersonal coordination may serve as a diagnostic marker of (mal)adaptive child development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Kamphorst","given":"Erica"},{"family":"Cantell","given":"Marja"},{"family":"Minnaert","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Houwen","given":"Suzanne"},{"family":"Cox","given":"Ralf"}],"citation-key":"kamphorstTuneMultimodalMotherChild2022","container-title":"Early Education and Development","container-title-short":"Early Education and Development","DOI":"10.1080/10409289.2022.2154008","ISSN":"1040-9289, 1556-6935","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,26]]},"language":"en","page":"1-27","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"In Tune?

Hedonic tone is the trait underlying one’s characteristic ability to feel pleasure. Low hedonic tone represents a reduced capacity to experience pleasure, thus increasing the likelihood of experiencing anhedonia. Low hedonic tone has been associated with several psychopathologies, including major depressive disorder (MDD), substance use, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The main neural pathway that modulates emotional affect comprises the limbic–cortical–striatal–pallidal–thalamic circuits. The activity of various components of the limbic–cortical–striatal–pallidal–thalamic pathway is correlated with hedonic tone in healthy individuals and is altered in MDD. Dysfunction of these circuits has also been implicated in the relative ineffectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors used to treat anxiety and depression in patients with low hedonic tone. Mood disorders such as MDD, ADHD, and substance abuse share low hedonic tone as well as altered activation of brain regions involved in reward processing and monoamine signaling as their features. Given the common features of these disorders, it is not surprising that they have high levels of comorbidities. The purpose of this article is to review the neurobiology of hedonic tone as it pertains to depression, ADHD, and the potential for substance abuse. We propose that, since low hedonic tone is a shared feature of MDD, ADHD, and substance abuse, evaluation of hedonic tone may become a diagnostic feature used to predict subtypes of MDD, such as treatment-resistant depression, as well as comorbidities of these disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Katzman","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Sternat","given":"Tia"}],"citation-key":"katzmanNeurobiologyHedonicTone2016","container-title":"Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment","container-title-short":"NDT","DOI":"10.2147/NDT.S111818","ISSN":"1178-2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8]]},"language":"en","page":"2149-2164","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neurobiology of hedonic tone: the relationship between treatment-resistant depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and substance abuse","title-short":"Neurobiology of hedonic tone","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.dovepress.com/neurobiology-of-hedonic-tone-the-relationship-between-treatment-resist-peer-reviewed-article-NDT","volume":"Volume 12"},{"id":"kaufmanAttentiondeficitHyperactivityDisorder2011","abstract":"Background: Athletic performance without beneﬁt from performance-enhancing substances is essential in amateur sports; yet, prohibiting speciﬁc medications creates discrimination against competitors with a medical illness. To avoid such inequalities, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) adopted international standards for therapeutic use exemptions (TUE). Attentiondeﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment within the athletic population is a unique challenge. Stimulants, ﬁrst-line treatment for ADHD, are prohibited unless alternative, nonprohibited medications have ﬁrst been tried and found ineffective. The world prevalence of ADHD is 5.3%; however, there are no ADHD prevalence studies in sports. This paper addresses ADHD in a boys’ gymnastics team, implications for further research with a proposed surveyquestionnaire to measure prevalence of ADHD with behavioral effects of gymnastics, and ethical considerations.\nMethod: Preliminary ADHD prevalence in a boys’ gymnastics team is presented with complementary literature review and a proposed survey-questionnaire to estimate actual ADHD prevalence in gymnastics populations with behavioral effects.\nResults: The parents of boys in a gymnastic reported that 5 of 7 (71.4%) boys were either diagnosed with ADHD in the past or had been treated with stimulant or non-stimulant medications for inattentive/hyperactive/impulsive behaviours. Parents described gymnastics as effective behavioral therapy in controlling/improving ADHD symptoms, with this effect extending into other environments (home/classroom). Only one parent was aware of WADA stimulant prohibition.\nConclusions: A surprisingly large ADHD prevalence is reported in one boys’ gymnastic team. Further research is required to verify this high ADHD prevalence and behavioral effects in gymnastics. A proposed survey-questionnaire to measure both ADHD prevalence and behavioral effects in gymnastics is presented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kaufman","given":"Kenneth R."},{"family":"Bajaj","given":"Anita"},{"family":"Schiltz","given":"John F."}],"citation-key":"kaufmanAttentiondeficitHyperactivityDisorder2011","container-title":"Apunts.

Whether or not a serious alternative is provided is not clear. Among the critics there is some consensus, however, that this role could be fulfilled by the concept of a 'behavioral system'.

A similar balancing act in the Ising (1925) model was found to produce patterns of electron spin alignment, analogous to the softassembly of locomotive patterns.

The mobile, which offers interesting sights and sounds, responds conjugately to the baby’s vigorous kicks which increase in rate by a factor of 3–4. In this paper, using the concepts, methods and tools of coordination dynamics, we present a theoretical model which reproduces the experimental observations of Rovee-Collier and others and predicts a number of additional features that can be experimentally tested. The model is a dynamical system consisting of three equations, one for the baby’s leg movements, one for the jiggling motion of the mobile and one for the functional coupling between the two. A key mechanism in the model is positive feedback which is shown to depend sensitively on bifurcation parameters related to the infant’s level of attention and inertial properties of the mobile.

Experiment 1 focuses on perceptual learning in dynamic touch, in which participants use exploratory handwielding of unseen objects to make visually guided length judgments and use visual feedback to rescale their judgments of the same mechanical information. Previous research found that the degree of fractal temporal scaling (i.e., “fractality”) in handwielding moderates the use of mechanical information. Experiment 1 shows that head-sway fractality moderates the use of visual information. Further, experience with feedback increases head-sway fractality and prolongs its effect on later hand-wielding fractality. Experiment 2 replicates effects of head-sway fractality moderating use of visual information in a purely visual judgment task.

One possible reason for this failure of ergodicity is the failure of biological and psychological processes to exhibit independence across time. Multifractal evidence has long suggested that biological and psychological processes show strong signatures of nonlinear interactions across scales. These cross-scale interactions sooner befit a cascadedynamical process than awGn. The present work thus compares awGn to simulations of multiplicative binomial cascades, submitting both types of series and shuffled versions of each to the Thirumalai-Mountain method for estimating ergodicity breaking. Estimating ergodicity breaking for original awGn and cascade series allows us to examine the sources of ergodicity breaking across the sequence, e.g., in temporal correlations specifying nonlinear interactions across scales, and examining ergodicity breaking of the shuffled series allows us to assess the raw, sequence-independent contribution of distributional properties (e.g., the heavy tails of a cascade) without the original temporal sequence. Raw cascade fluctuations and the standard deviation (𝑆𝐷) and root mean square (𝑅𝑀𝑆) series describing those raw fluctuations break ergodicity, but nonlinear, cascade-dynamical descriptors: multifractal spectrum width (Δ𝛼) and multifractal nonlinearity (𝑡𝑀𝐹 ), maintain ergodicity. Interestingly, the fundamentally linear descriptor, fractal Hurst exponent (𝐻𝑓𝐺𝑛) shows moderate ergodicity breaking when describing the fundamentally nonlinear cascade processes, but the linear descriptor coefficient of variation (𝐶𝑉 ) controls for multiplicative relationships between 𝑆𝐷 and 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛 and maintains ergodicity. We conclude that the ergodicity of statistical descriptors depends on how well they can portray nonlinearity (Δ𝛼 and 𝑡𝑀𝐹 ) or at least multiplicativity (𝐶𝑉 ) of the underlying cascade processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Kelty-Stephen","given":"Damian G."},{"family":"Mangalam","given":"Madhur"}],"citation-key":"kelty-stephenMultifractalDescriptorsErgodically2023","container-title":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","container-title-short":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","DOI":"10.1016/j.physa.2023.128651","ISSN":"03784371","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5]]},"language":"en","page":"128651","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Multifractal descriptors ergodically characterize non-ergodic multiplicative cascade processes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378437123002066","volume":"617"},{"id":"kelty-stephenMultifractalityMonoFractality2017","abstract":"This article addresses the still popular but incorrect idea that monofractal (sometimes called “fractal” for short) structure might be a deﬁnitive signature of nonlinearity and, as a corollary, that monofractal analyses are nonlinear analyses.

These mathematical steps include multifractal analysis and surrogate data production for resolving when multifractality entails nonlinear changes over time.

In this paper we start from Koffka’s recommendation in his\n              Principles of Gestalt Psychology\n              that to realize this ambition psychology should be a “science of molar behaviour”. Molar behavior refers to the purposeful behaviour of the whole organism directed at an environment that is meaningfully structured for the animal. Koffka made a sharp distinction between the “behavioural environment” and the “geographical environment”. We show how this distinction picks out the difference between the environment as perceived by an individual organism, and the shared publicly available environment. The ecological psychologist James Gibson was later critical of Koffka for inserting a private phenomenal reality in between animals and the shared environment. Gibson tried to make do with just the concept of affordances in his explanation of molar behaviour. We argue however that psychology as a science of molar behaviour will need to make appeal both to the concepts of shared publicly available affordances, and of the multiplicity of\n              relevant\n              affordances that invite an individual to act. A version of Koffka’s distinction between the two environments remains alive today in a distinction we have made between the field and landscape of affordances. Having distinguished the two environments, we go on to provide an account of how the two environments are related. Koffka suggested that the behavioural environment forms out of the causal interaction of the individual with a pre-existing, ready-made geographical environment. We argue that such an account of the relation between the two environments fails to do justice to the complex entanglement of the social with the material aspects of the geographical environment. To better account for this sociomaterial reality of the geographical environment, we propose a process-perspective on our distinction between the landscape and field of affordances. While the two environments can be conceptually distinguished, we argue they should also be viewed as standing in a relation of reciprocal and mutual dependence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kiverstein","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Van Dijk","given":"Ludger"},{"family":"Rietveld","given":"Erik"}],"citation-key":"kiversteinFieldLandscapeAffordances2021","container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-019-02123-x","ISSN":"0039-7857, 1573-0964","issue":"S9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5]]},"language":"en","page":"2279-2296","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The field and landscape of affordances: Koffka’s two environments revisited","title-short":"The field and landscape of affordances","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11229-019-02123-x","volume":"198"},{"id":"kiversteinFreeEnergySelf2020","abstract":"According to the free energy principle all living systems aim to minimise free energy in their sensory exchanges with the environment. Processes of free energy minimisation are thus ubiquitous in the biological world. Indeed it has been argued that even plants engage in free energy minimisation. Not all living things however feel alive. How then did the feeling of being alive get started? In line with the arguments of the phenomenologists, I will claim that every feeling must be felt by someone. It must have mineness built into it if it is to feel a particular way. The question I take up in this paper asks how mineness might have arisen out of processes of free energy minimisation, given that many systems that keep themselves alive lack mineness. The hypothesis I develop in this paper is that the life of an organism can be seen as an inferential process. Every living system embodies a probability distribution conditioned on a model of the sensory, physiological, and morphological states that are highly probably given the life it leads and the niche it inhabits. I argue for an ecological and enactive interpretation of free energy. I show how once the life of an organism reaches a certain level of complexity mineness emerges as an intrinsic part of the process of life itself.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kiverstein","given":"Julian"}],"citation-key":"kiversteinFreeEnergySelf2020","container-title":"Topoi","container-title-short":"Topoi","DOI":"10.1007/s11245-018-9561-5","ISSN":"0167-7411, 1572-8749","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7]]},"language":"en","page":"559-574","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Free Energy and the Self: An Ecological–Enactive Interpretation","title-short":"Free Energy and the Self","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11245-018-9561-5","volume":"39"},{"id":"kiversteinLanguageRepresentationGibsons2021","abstract":"Ecological psychology isn't just a psychology of perception and action but offers a post-cognitivist approach to psychology as a whole. In this paper we explore how the conceptual tools of ecological psychology might be put to work to account for linguistic deeds, the activities people can perform when they are competent speakers of a language. We pursue this question by starting from a suggestion Gibson made that language use and perception co-shape each other. However such a relation of reciprocity between active perception and linguistic practices has generally not been taken to heart in ecological psychology. The relation between first-hand perception, based on natural laws, and second-hand perception, enabled by social and cultural convention, has been understood hierarchically not reciprocally. We show there is a trace of a traditional (cognitivist) view of language in how Gibson characterised what people do when they talk to each other. A second obstacle to a reciprocal reading lies in Gibson's concept of information. Gibson argued explicitly against thinking of ecological information for perception as a quantity that can be transmitted. However, when it comes to language he treated information as a commodity, as something that can be re-presented, contained and transferred through conventional patterns, through speaking, writing and depiction. In order to move away from a traditional cognitivist picture of language as mediated by systems of representations, we offer an alternative usage-based view of information, one where information is not a thing that can be re-presented, in language or anywhere else. This allows us to fully set aside the assumption that language is re-presentational and symbolic at heart and follow through on the post-cognitivist ambitions of ecological psychology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Kiverstein","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Dijk","given":"Ludger","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"kiversteinLanguageRepresentationGibsons2021","container-title":"Language Sciences","container-title-short":"Language Sciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.langsci.2021.101380","ISSN":"0388-0001","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,1]]},"page":"101380","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Language without representation: Gibson's first- and second-hand perception on a pragmatic continuum1","title-short":"Language without representation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0388000121000279","volume":"85"},{"id":"kiversteinProblemMeaningFree2022","abstract":"Biological agents can act in ways that express a sensitivity to context-dependent relevance. So far it has proven difficult to engineer this capacity for context-dependent sensitivity to relevance in artificial agents. We give this problem the label the “problem of meaning”. The problem of meaning could be circumvented if artificial intelligence researchers were to design agents based on the assumption of the continuity of life and mind. In this paper, we focus on the proposal made by enactive cognitive scientists to design artificial agents that possess sensorimotor autonomy—stable, self-sustaining patterns of sensorimotor interaction that can ground values, norms and goals necessary for encountering a meaningful environment. More specifically, we consider whether the Free Energy Principle (FEP) can provide formal tools for modeling sensorimotor autonomy. There is currently no consensus on how to understand the relationship between enactive cognitive science and the FEP. However, a number of recent papers have argued that the two frameworks are fundamentally incompatible. Some argue that biological systems exhibit historical path-dependent learning that is absent from systems that minimize free energy. Others have argued that a free energy minimizing system would fail to satisfy a key condition for sensorimotor agency referred to as “interactional asymmetry”. These critics question the claim we defend in this paper that the FEP can be used to formally model autonomy and adaptivity. We will argue it is too soon to conclude that the two frameworks are incompatible. There are undeniable conceptual differences between the two frameworks but in our view each has something important and necessary to offer. The FEP needs enactive cognitive science for the solution it provides to the problem of meaning. Enactive cognitive science needs the FEP to formally model the properties it argues to be constitutive of agency. Our conclusion will be that active inference models based on the FEP provides a way by which scientists can think about how to address the problems of engineering autonomy and adaptivity in artificial agents in formal terms. In the end engaging more closely with this formalism and its further developments will benefit those working within the enactive framework.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kiverstein","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Kirchhoff","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Froese","given":"Tom"}],"citation-key":"kiversteinProblemMeaningFree2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Neurorobotics","container-title-short":"Front.

We also provide readers with a “how to” guide that summarizes four essential steps along with analytical methods (e.g., sequential and pattern analyses, mixed-methods research, abductive reasoning) that are applicable to the broad scope of high-resolution methods.","container-title":"Organizational Psychology Review","DOI":"10.1177/2041386619886674","ISSN":"2041-3866, 2041-3874","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"Organizational Psychology Review","language":"en","page":"245-275","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Time to go wild: How to conceptualize and measure process dynamics in real teams with high-resolution","title-short":"Time to go wild","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2041386619886674","volume":"9","author":[{"family":"Klonek","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Gerpott","given":"Fabiola Heike"},{"family":"Lehmann-Willenbrock","given":"Nale"},{"family":"Parker","given":"Sharon K."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11]]},"citation-key":"klonekTimeGoWild2019a","library":"My Library","citekey":"klonekTimeGoWild2019a"},{"id":"kloosSoftAssembledMechanismsUnified2009","abstract":"Abstract\n            This chapter argues that connectionist and dynamic systems models complement each other and collectively move toward a unified theory of development if they subscribe to the second view of mechanism—one that treats behavior as soft assembled in the immediate context.

The argument is that a reduction of behavior requires human performance to be relatively context free. However, it is shown with the example of balance task performance that human performance is highly context dependent, even in the sterile laboratory context of balance experiments. The chapter then elaborates on what such context dependence could mean. The chapter reviews more pointed evidence for soft assembly and discusses why models that take soft assembly seriously—connectionist or dynamic systems—anticipate the unified theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kloos","given":"Heidi"},{"family":"Van Orden","given":"Guy C."}],"citation-key":"kloosSoftAssembledMechanismsUnified2009","container-title":"Toward a Unified Theory of Development Connectionism and Dynamic System Theory Re-Consider","DOI":"10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195300598.003.0012","edition":"1","editor":[{"family":"Spencer","given":"John"}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-530059-8 978-0-19-986716-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"253-267","publisher":"Oxford University PressNew York","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Soft-Assembled Mechanisms for the Unified Theory","type":"chapter","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/1941/chapter/141747888"},{"id":"kloosVoluntaryBehaviorCognitive2010","abstract":"Many previous treatments of voluntary behavior have viewed intentions as causes of behavior.

Measuring this coordination faces a major challenge. Time series obtained from such cognitive, behavioral, and physiological coordination are often complicated in terms of non-stationarity and non-linearity, and in terms of continuous vs. categorical scales. Researchers have proposed several analytical tools and frameworks. One method designed to overcome these complexities is recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis, developed in the study of non-linear dynamics. It has been applied in various domains, including linguistic (categorical) data or motion (continuous) data. However, most previous studies have applied recurrence methods individually to categorical or continuous data. To understand how complex coordination works, an integration of these types of behavior is needed. We aimed to integrate these methods to investigate the relationship between language (categorical) and motion (continuous) directly. To do so, we added temporal information (a time stamp) to categorical data (i.e., language), and applied joint recurrence analysis methods to visualize and quantify speech-motion coordination coupling during a rap performance. We illustrate how new dynamic methods may capture this coordination in a small case-study design on this expert rap performance. We describe a case study suggesting this kind of dynamic analysis holds promise, and end by discussing the theoretical implications of studying complex performances of this kind as a dynamic, coordinated phenomenon.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Kodama","given":"Kentaro"},{"family":"Shimizu","given":"Daichi"},{"family":"Dale","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Sekine","given":"Kazuki"}],"citation-key":"kodamaApproachAligningCategorical2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

Emotion dysregulation is a core feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD), which often co-occurs with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Difficulties in emotion regulation (ER) have been linked to lower high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), a measure of autonomous nervous system functioning. However, previous research on vagallymediated heart rate in BPD revealed heterogeneous findings and the effects of comorbid PTSD and dissociation on HF-HRV are not yet completely understood. This study aim to investigate HF-HRV during resting-state and an ER task in female BPD patients with comorbid PTSD (BPD + PTSD), patients without this comorbidity (BPD), and healthy controls (HC).\nMethods. 57 BPD patients (BPD: n = 37, BPD + PTSD: n = 20) and 27 HC performed an ER task with neutral, positive, and negative images. Participants were instructed to either attend these pictures or to down-regulate their upcoming emotions using cognitive reappraisal. Subjective arousal and wellbeing, self-reported dissociation, and electrocardiogram data were assessed.\nResults. Independent of ER instruction and picture valence, both patient groups (BPD and BPD + PTSD) reported higher subjective arousal and lower wellbeing; patients with BPD + PTSD further exhibited significantly lower HF-HRV compared with the other groups. Higher self-reported state dissociation predicted higher HF-HRV during down-regulating v. attending negative pictures in BPD + PTSD.\nConclusions. Findings suggest increased emotional reactivity to negative, positive, and neutral pictures, but do not provide evidence for deficits in instructed ER in BPD. Reduced HF-HRV appears to be particularly linked to comorbid PTSD, while dissociation may underlie attempts to increase ER and HF-HRV in BPD patients with this comorbidity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Krause-Utz","given":"Annegret"},{"family":"Walther","given":"Julia-Caroline"},{"family":"Lis","given":"Stefanie"},{"family":"Schmahl","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Bohus","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"krause-utzHeartRateVariability2019","container-title":"Psychological Medicine","container-title-short":"Psychol.

The underlying theoretical assumption of such framing is that organizations are open systems. This paper presents an alternative view, derived from the theory of social systems autopoiesis. It proposes that organizations, being open systems, are yet operationally closed, as all their activities and interactions with the environment are aspects of just one process: the recursive production of themselves, according to a pattern of their own identity. It is their identity that captures exactly what can and what cannot be sustained in their continuous self-production. Examining the organizational identity of universities within the theoretical framework of autopoiesis may hence shed new light on their resistance to change, explaining it as a systemic and social phenomenon, rather than an individual and psychological one. Since all processes of an autopoietic system are processes of its selfproduction, this paper argues that in the case of traditional European universities, the identity consists in the intertwinement of only two processes: (1) introducing continuous change in the scope of scientiﬁc knowledge and (2) educating new generations of scholars, who will carry on this activity.

Yet, the most healthful lifestyle changes people can (and often want to) make, also tend to be the most challenging to sustain. This dissertation explores how modeling behavior as a dynamical system could improve understanding of psychological processes that sustain behavioral changes. I focus on two classes of processes—motivational and habitual—that may be most pertinent to sustaining changes in physical exercise. A model based on prior theorizing is constructed and simulated (Study 1), and observational data are analyzed (Study 2). Intensive longitudinal data are collected from healthy US-based Fitbit users who recently initiated an increase in exercise. Participants are prospectively observed for two months during which measures of motivation and habit are assessed three days per week, and exerciseas-usual is passively tracked via Fitbit. I find that within-person increases in the automaticity with which exercise is performed in a given week is associated with increases in time spent exercising. Furthermore, differences in the trajectory of automaticity and satisfaction with exercise over time may differentiate those who successfully maintain increases in exercise and those who do not. Results are placed in the context of contemporary theories of behavior change maintenance and suggestions for improvement are forwarded.","author":[{"family":"Lenne","given":"Richard L"}],"citation-key":"lenneSUBMITTEDFACULTYUNIVERSITY","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"SUBMITTED TO THE FACULTY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA BY","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"leonardiVocalInteractionsDawn2016","abstract":"Continuous interaction of mother and infant in the first weeks and months of an infant’s life entrains the infant on many crucial aspects of how to do things together. Contingencies of gaze, vocalizations, and other movements are slowly routinized; this scaffolds directing of attention to each other and the world and gives to such multimodal interactions meaning. It is within these continuous interactions with caregivers that language emerges, starting from the first nonreflexive vocalizations that infants produce. The response that caregivers promptly give to these vocalizations informs infants of their relevance and helps shape them. We explored this systematicity by observing the coupling of infants’ and mothers’ vocalizations in unconstrained interactions longitudinally. While at three months, mothers seem to answer consistently to any speech related vocalization within the first two seconds, this pattern fades away at six and eight months. What remains stable across age is a structure in which overlapping vocalizations are rare and give way to a sequential pattern of vocal reciprocity — an embryonic turn-taking behavior.

Musical pitch fluctuations follow a 1/\n              f\n              power law that precisely achieves this balance. Musical rhythms, especially those of Western classical music, are considered highly regular and predictable, and this predictability has been hypothesized to underlie rhythm's contribution to our enjoyment of music. Are musical rhythms indeed entirely predictable and how do they vary with genre and composer? To answer this question, we analyzed the rhythm spectra of 1,788 movements from 558 compositions of Western classical music. We found that an overwhelming majority of rhythms obeyed a 1/\n              f\n              β\n              power law across 16 subgenres and 40 composers, with β ranging from ∼0.5–1. Notably, classical composers, whose compositions are known to exhibit nearly identical 1/\n              f\n              pitch spectra, demonstrated distinctive 1/\n              f\n              rhythm spectra: Beethoven's rhythms were among the most predictable, and Mozart's among the least. Our finding of the ubiquity of 1/\n              f\n              rhythm spectra in compositions spanning nearly four centuries demonstrates that, as with musical pitch, musical rhythms also exhibit a balance of predictability and surprise that could contribute in a fundamental way to our aesthetic experience of music. Although music compositions are intended to be performed, the fact that the notated rhythms follow a 1/\n              f\n              spectrum indicates that such structure is no mere artifact of performance or perception, but rather, exists within the written composition before the music is performed. Furthermore, composers systematically manipulate (consciously or otherwise) the predictability in 1/\n              f\n              rhythms to give their compositions unique identities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Levitin","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Chordia","given":"Parag"},{"family":"Menon","given":"Vinod"}],"citation-key":"levitinMusicalRhythmSpectra2012","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

Furthermore, it is argued that this dance routine would have been an effective breeding ground for the development of a psychological regulatory system that could powerfully enforce cooperation by collectively targeting individuals who do not or cannot conform to the melody or the beat – i.e. misfits who do not achieve synchrony with the other members of the dance group.

However, traditional methods of analysis ignore important temporal variations in these explanations. This study investigated how dynamical systems theory could be used to reveal linguistic patterns that are predictive of self-explanation quality. High school students (n = 232) generated self-explanations while they read a science text. Recurrence Plots were generated to show qualitative differences in students’ linguistic sequences that were later quantified by indices derived by Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). To predict self-explanation quality, RQA indices, along with summative measures (i.e., number of words, mean word length, and type-token ration) and general reading ability, served as predictors in a series of regression models. Regression analyses indicated that recurrence in students’ self-explanations significantly predicted human rated self-explanation quality, even after controlling for summative measures of self-explanations, individual differences, and the text that was read (R2 = 0.68). These results demonstrate the utility of RQA in exposing and quantifying temporal structure in student’s self-explanations. Further, they imply that dynamical systems methodology can be used to uncover important processes that occur during comprehension.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Likens","given":"Aaron D."},{"family":"McCarthy","given":"Kathryn S."},{"family":"Allen","given":"Laura K."},{"family":"McNamara","given":"Danielle S."}],"citation-key":"likensRecurrenceQuantificationAnalysis2018","container-title":"Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge","DOI":"10.1145/3170358.3170407","event-place":"Sydney New South Wales Australia","event-title":"LAK '18: International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6400-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,7]]},"language":"en","page":"111-120","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"Sydney New South Wales Australia","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Recurrence quantification analysis as a method for studying text comprehension dynamics","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3170358.3170407"},{"id":"likensStatisticalPropertiesMultiscale2019","abstract":"Multiscale Regression Analysis (MRA) is a promising new tool for the analysis of bivariate time series that is based on Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. The method was developed within the economics and environmental science literatures (Kristoufek, 2015, 2018; Kristoufek and Ferreira, 2018) and is beginning to be applied in other scientific domains. To date, however, no systematic studies have investigated the behavior of the estimator with respect to short time series. This paper fills that gap by assessing the performance of the MRA estimator using time series with varying length, distribution, and structure (e.g., autocorrelation, stationarity). Simulations show that MRA performs well under many circumstances with as few as 512 observations. Linear and quadratic time trends contribute considerable systematic bias; however, using a detrending polynomial of order ≥ 2 effectively attenuates time trend associated deviations from expected values. We apply MRA to a previously published dataset in order to explore the relationship that emerges between body segments during an act of quiet standing. Results suggest that the velocity of the hip asymptotically depends on velocity of the ankle. In contrast, ankle velocity was a much weaker predictor of shoulder velocity. We conclude by providing suggestions for best practice and future model development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Likens","given":"Aaron D."},{"family":"Amazeen","given":"Polemnia G."},{"family":"West","given":"Stephen G."},{"family":"Gibbons","given":"Cameron T."}],"citation-key":"likensStatisticalPropertiesMultiscale2019","container-title":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","container-title-short":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","DOI":"10.1016/j.physa.2019.121580","ISSN":"03784371","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10]]},"language":"en","page":"121580","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Statistical properties of Multiscale Regression Analysis: Simulation and application to human postural control","title-short":"Statistical properties of Multiscale Regression Analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378437119309331","volume":"532"},{"id":"linderholmCollegeStudentsBeliefs2010","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Linderholm","given":"Tracy"},{"family":"Wilde","given":"Adam"}],"citation-key":"linderholmCollegeStudentsBeliefs2010","container-title":"Journal of College Reading and Learning","container-title-short":"Journal of College Reading and Learning","DOI":"10.1080/10790195.2010.10850327","ISSN":"1079-0195, 2332-7413","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",3]]},"language":"en","page":"7-19","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"College Students' Beliefs about Comprehension When Reading for Different Purposes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10790195.2010.10850327","volume":"40"},{"id":"lindgrenEnhancingLearningEngagement2016","abstract":"Computer simulations have been shown to be effective instruments for teaching students about difﬁcult concepts, particularly in the STEM disciplines.

At the same time, the strong form of the embodied cognition hypothesis is at variance with currently available neuropsychological evidence.

However, the differences in communication styles between humans and AI often prevent human teammates from fully understanding the intent and needs of AI teammates. One core difference is that humans naturally leverage a positive emotional tone during communication to convey their confidence or lack thereof to convey doubt in their ability to complete a task. Yet, this communication strategy must be explicitly designed in order for an AI teammate to be human-centered. In this mixed-methods study, 45 participants completed a study examining how human teammates interpret the behaviors of their AI teammates when they express different positive emotions via specific words/phrases. Quantitative results show that, based on corresponding behaviors, AI teammates were able to use displays of emotion to increase trust in AI teammates and the positive mood of the human teammate. Additionally, our qualitative findings indicate that participants preferred their AI teammates to increase the intensity of their displayed emotions to help reduce the perceived risk of their AI teammate’s behavior. When taken in sum, these findings describe the relevance of AI teammates expressing intensities of emotion while performing various behavioral decisions as a continued means to provide social support to the wider team and better task performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Mallick","given":"Rohit"},{"family":"Flathmann","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Duan","given":"Wen"},{"family":"Schelble","given":"Beau G."},{"family":"McNeese","given":"Nathan J."}],"citation-key":"mallickWhatYouSay2024","container-title":"International Journal of Human-Computer Studies","container-title-short":"International Journal of Human-Computer Studies","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhcs.2024.103355","ISSN":"10715819","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12]]},"language":"en","page":"103355","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"What you say vs what you do: Utilizing positive emotional expressions to relay AI teammate intent within human–AI teams","title-short":"What you say vs what you do","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1071581924001381","volume":"192"},{"id":"manciniDyadicAffectiveFlexibility2016","abstract":"The current review examines characteristics of temporal affective functioning at both the individual and dyadic level.

However, neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, which often manifest as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia, disrupt this healthy variability. This study examined postural sway in young and older adults, including individuals with Parkinson’s disease, under different upright standing conditions to investigate the potential connection between the temporal structure of variability in postural sway and Parkinsonism. A novel and innovative method called oriented fractal scaling component analysis was employed. This method involves decomposing the two-dimensional center of pressure (CoP) planar trajectories to pinpoint the directions associated with minimal and maximal temporal correlations in postural sway. As a result, it facilitates a comprehensive assessment of the directional characteristics within the temporal structure of sway variability. The results demonstrated that healthy adults control posture along two orthogonal directions closely aligned with the traditional anatomical anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) directions. In contrast, older adults and individuals with Parkinson’s disease controlled posture along suborthogonal directions that significantly deviate from the AP and ML directions. Moreover, changes in the temporal structure of variability in postural sway predict changes in its directional characteristics. These findings suggest that the altered temporal structure of sway variability is evident in individuals with Parkinson’s disease and underlies postural deficits, surpassing what can be explained solely by the natural aging process. Importantly, this method of assessing the directional characteristics of the temporal structure of sway variability can produce potential biomarkers for the early detection of Parkinson’s disease that can aid the diagnostic process, facilitating timely interventions and monitoring of disease progression.","author":[{"family":"Mangalam","given":"Madhur"},{"family":"Kelty-Stephen","given":"Damian G"},{"family":"Seleznov","given":"Ivan"},{"family":"Popov","given":"Anton"},{"family":"Likens","given":"D"},{"family":"Kiyono","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Stergiou","given":"Nick"}],"citation-key":"mangalamOlderAdultsIndividuals","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Older adults and individuals with Parkinson’s disease control posture along suborthogonal directions that deviate from the traditional anteroposterior and mediolateral directions","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"mansourizadehCitationPracticesNonnative2011","abstract":"Citation is one of the most prominent features of academic writing through which academic writers both exhibit the breadth of their scholarship in a speciﬁc research area and subtly demonstrate their memberships of the disciplinary community.

Three crucial characteristics of aesthetic experience are discussed: fascination with an aesthetic object (high arousal and attention), appraisal of the symbolic reality of an object (high cognitive engagement), and a strong feeling of unity with the object of aesthetic fascination and aesthetic appraisal. In a proposed model, two parallel levels of aesthetic information processing are proposed. On the ﬁrst level two sub-levels of narrative are processed, story (theme) and symbolism (deeper meanings). The second level includes two sub-levels, perceptual associations (implicit meanings of object’s physical features) and detection of compositional regularities. Two sub-levels are deﬁned as crucial for aesthetic experience, appraisal of symbolism and compositional regularities. These sub-levels require some speciﬁc cognitive and personality dispositions, such as expertise, creative thinking, and openness to experience. Finally, feedback of emotional processing is included in our model: appraisals of everyday emotions are speciﬁed as a matter of narrative content (eg, empathy with characters), whereas the aesthetic emotion is deﬁned as an affective evaluation in the process of symbolism appraisal or the detection of compositional regularities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Marković","given":"Slobodan"}],"citation-key":"markovicComponentsAestheticExperience2012","container-title":"i-Perception","container-title-short":"i-Perception","DOI":"10.1068/i0450aap","ISSN":"2041-6695, 2041-6695","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-17","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Components of Aesthetic Experience: Aesthetic Fascination, Aesthetic Appraisal, and Aesthetic Emotion","title-short":"Components of Aesthetic Experience","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/i0450aap","volume":"3"},{"id":"martinRedundancySelfMotionMotor2009","abstract":"Outside the laboratory, human movement typically involves redundant effector systems. How the nervous system selects among the task-equivalent solutions may provide insights into how movement is controlled. We propose a process model of movement generation that accounts for the kinematics of goal-directed pointing movements performed with a redundant arm. The key element is a neuronal dynamics that generates a virtual joint trajectory. This dynamics receives input from a neuronal timer that paces end-effector motion along its path. Within this dynamics, virtual joint velocity vectors that move the end effector are dynamically decoupled from velocity vectors that do not. Moreover, the sensed real joint configuration is coupled back into this neuronal dynamics, updating the virtual trajectory so that it yields to task-equivalent deviations from the dynamic movement plan. Experimental data from participants who perform in the same task setting as the model are compared in detail to the model predictions. We discover that joint velocities contain a substantial amount of self-motion that does not move the end effector. This is caused by the low impedance of muscle joint systems and by coupling among muscle joint systems due to multiarticulatory muscles. Back-coupling amplifies the induced control errors. We establish a link between the amount of self-motion and how curved the end-effector path is. We show that models in which an inverse dynamics cancels interaction torques predict too little selfmotion and too straight end-effector paths.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Martin","given":"V."},{"family":"Scholz","given":"J.

A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980’s. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantiﬁcation of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system’s behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own ﬁeld of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difﬁculties and pitfalls.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Marwan","given":"N"},{"family":"Carmenromano","given":"M"},{"family":"Thiel","given":"M"},{"family":"Kurths","given":"J"}],"citation-key":"marwanRecurrencePlotsAnalysis2007","container-title":"Physics Reports","container-title-short":"Physics Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.physrep.2006.11.001","ISSN":"03701573","issue":"5-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",1]]},"language":"en","page":"237-329","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Recurrence plots for the analysis of complex systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0370157306004066","volume":"438"},{"id":"mattsonBeneficialEffectsIntermittent2005","abstract":"Intermittent fasting ( IF; reduced meal frequency) and caloric restriction (CR) extend lifespan and increase resistance to age-related diseases in rodents and monkeys and improve the health of overweight humans.

Cardiovascular stress adaptation is improved and heart rate variability is increased in rodents maintained on an IF or a CR diet. Moreover, rodents maintained on an IF regimen exhibit increased resistance of heart and brain cells to ischemic injury in experimental models of myocardial infarction and stroke. The beneficial effects of IF and CR result from at least two mechanisms —reduced oxidative damage and increased cellular stress resistance. Recent findings suggest that some of the beneficial effects of IF on both the cardiovascular system and the brain are mediated by brain- derived neurotrophic factor signaling in the brain. Interestingly, cellular and molecular effects of IF and CR on the cardiovascular system and the brain are similar to those of regular physical exercise, suggesting shared mechanisms. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which IF and CR affect the blood vessels and heart and brain cells will likely lead to novel preventative and therapeutic strategies for extending health span.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Mattson","given":"M"},{"family":"Wan","given":"R"}],"citation-key":"mattsonBeneficialEffectsIntermittent2005","container-title":"The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry","container-title-short":"The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.jnutbio.2004.12.007","ISSN":"09552863","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",3]]},"language":"en","page":"129-137","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Beneficial effects of intermittent fasting and caloric restriction on the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S095528630400261X","volume":"16"},{"id":"mcdanielFacialFeaturesAffective2007","abstract":"This study investigated facial features to detect the affective states (or emotions) that accompany deep-level learning of conceptual material.

To illustrate the manifold opportunities of (C)RQA, we present three application examples focusing on individuals as systems, dyads as systems, and teams as systems. Speciﬁcally, we highlight how (C)RQA can be applied to individual diary data, to leader-follower communication dynamics observed during annual appraisal interviews, and to high-density coded team interactions observed during organizational meetings.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fractal heart rate dynamics in adults with Down syndrome (DS) under different physiological conditions (rest, exercise and post-exercise recovery) and compare their responses with those of nondisabled individuals. Fourteen participants (10 males; and 4 females) with DS and 13 nondisabled (9 males, and 4 females) controls performed maximal and submaximal treadmill tests with metabolic and heart rate measurements. Detrended fluctuation analysis was performed on the last 256 consecutive R–R intervals obtained under the following conditions: (1) standing rest, (2) submaximal treadmill exercise and (3) standing post-exercise recovery. Participants with DS presented lower chronotropic response than controls to peak and submaximal exercise (p<0.05). The short-term scaling exponent (α1) was greater in the DS group at rest (1.29±0.06 vs 1.07±0.08), during exercise (1.24±0.09 vs 0.99±0.08) and recovery (1.31±0.06 vs 1.21±0.06) (p<0.05). Furthermore, the fractal scaling distance score (I1−α1I) of participants with DS was also greater than that of controls under each physiological condition (p<0.05). This confirmed their greater fractal distance from the healthy value of 1.0. In conclusion, adults with DS show a breakdown of scale-invariant organization in heart rate dynamics towards Brownian noise and this is similar to that described in healthy aging.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Mendonca","given":"Goncalo V."},{"family":"Pereira","given":"Fernando D."},{"family":"Fernhall","given":"Bo"}],"citation-key":"mendoncaFractalScalingProperties2011","collection-title":"Special Section: A selection of papers from the 6th Congress of the International Society for Autonomic Neuroscience (ISAN), September, 2009","container-title":"Autonomic Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Autonomic Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1016/j.autneu.2010.12.007","ISSN":"1566-0702","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",4,26]]},"page":"110-115","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Fractal scaling properties of heart rate dynamics in persons with Down syndrome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566070211000282","volume":"161"},{"id":"menninghausAestheticEmotionsAre2020","abstract":"Our theoretical model (Menninghaus et al., 2019) defines aesthetic emotions by reference to their role in aesthetic evaluation, and specifically as being predictive of aesthetic liking/disliking.

Each aesthetic emotion is tuned to a special type of perceived aesthetic appeal and is predictive of the subjectively felt pleasure or displeasure and the liking or disliking associated with this type of appeal. Contrary to the negativity bias of classical emotion catalogues, emotion terms used for aesthetic evaluation purposes include far more positive than negative emotions. At the same time, many overall positive aesthetic emotions encompass negative or mixed emotional ingredients. Appraisals of intrinsic pleasantness, familiarity, and novelty are preeminently important for aesthetic emotions. Appraisals of goal relevance/conduciveness and coping potential are largely irrelevant from a pragmatic perspective, but in some cases highly relevant for cognitive and affective coping. Aesthetic emotions are typically sought and savored for their own sake, with subjectively felt intensity and/or emotional arousal being rewards in their own right. The expression component of aesthetic emotions includes laughter, tears, and facial and bodily movements, along with applause or booing and words of praise or blame. Aesthetic emotions entail motivational approach and avoidance tendencies, specifically, tendencies toward prolonged, repeated, or interrupted exposure and wanting to possess aesthetically pleasing objects.

Here we propose and examine five fundamental constraints that bear on theories of how music and some of its features may have originated. First, cultural transmission, bringing the formal powers of cultural as contrasted with Darwinian evolution to bear on its contents. Second, generativity, i.e. the fact that music generates infinite pattern diversity by finite means. Third, vocal production learning, without which there can be no human singing. Fourth, entrainment with perfect synchrony, without which there is neither rhythmic ensemble music nor rhythmic dancing to music.

Stimulants are frequently used in the management of ADHD. Due to adverse effects of medication there is a growing interest in complementary treatments. Complementary and alternative medicine therapies including yoga are commonly used in children with ADHD, but little is known about the efficacy of these therapies. Yoga requires long periods of concentration and is therefore supposed to reduce attention deficits. The published investigations without a control group report positive effects of yoga on ADHD symptoms and school performance. However, these studies do not allow causal conclusions in regard to the effects of yoga in the treatment of ADHD. The findings from exploratory randomized controlled studies suggest that future research on the efficacy of yoga in ADHD may yield results of therapeutic value. At present the small number of available investigations renders impossible the drawing of any conclusions regarding the effectiveness of yoga for ADHD in children.

We use data from an experiment where teams of three people built origami boats together in an assembly-line manner while their heart rate, skin conductance, and facial muscle activity were recorded. Our results show that physiological synchrony of skin conductance measures and eletromyographic measures of the corrugator supercilii develops spontaneously among team members during this cooperative production task. Moreover, high team synchrony is found indicative of team cohesion, while low team synchrony is found indicative of a teams' decision to adopt a new behavior across multiple production sessions.

Recently psychological researchers from multiple areas of psychology have become interested in nonverbal synchrony (i.e., coordinated motion between two individuals engaged in dyadic information exchange such as communication or dance) as a predictor and outcome of psychological processes. An important step in studying nonverbal synchrony is systematically and validly diﬀerentiating synchronous systems from non-synchronous systems. However, many current methods of testing and quantifying nonverbal synchrony will show some level of observed synchrony even when research participants have not interacted with one another. In this article we demonstrate the use of surrogate data generation methodology as a means of testing new null-hypotheses for synchrony between bivariate time series such as those derived from modern motion tracking methods. Hypotheses generated by surrogate data generation methods are more nuanced and meaningful than hypotheses from standard null-hypothesis testing. We review four surrogate data generation methods for testing for signiﬁcant nonverbal synchrony within a windowed cross-correlation (WCC) framework. We also interpret the null-hypotheses generated by these surrogate data generation methods with respect to nonverbal synchrony as a speciﬁc use of surrogate data generation, which can then be generalized for hypothesis testing other repeated observation psychological data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Moulder","given":"Robert G."},{"family":"Boker","given":"Steven M."},{"family":"Ramseyer","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Tschacher","given":"Wolfgang"}],"citation-key":"moulderDeterminingSynchronyBehavioral2018","container-title":"Psychological Methods","container-title-short":"Psychological Methods","DOI":"10.1037/met0000172","ISSN":"1939-1463, 1082-989X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"language":"en","page":"757-773","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Determining synchrony between behavioral time series: An application of surrogate data generation for establishing falsifiable null-hypotheses.","title-short":"Determining synchrony between behavioral time series","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/met0000172","volume":"23"},{"id":"muisCuriousCaseClimate2014","author":[{"family":"Muis","given":"Krista"},{"family":"Pekrun","given":"Reinhard"},{"family":"Sinatra","given":"Gale"},{"family":"Azevedo","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Trevors","given":"Gregory"},{"family":"Vogl","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Heddy","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"muisCuriousCaseClimate2014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,1]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"The Curious Case of Climate Change: Epistemic Emotions Mediate Relations Between Epistemic Beliefs, Learning Strategies, and Learning Outcomes","title-short":"The Curious Case of Climate Change","type":"book"},{"id":"muisMainModeratorEffects2018","abstract":"We explored the role that epistemic emotions play in conceptual change, specifically whether task value served as an antecedent to these emotions and whether type of text (refutation or expository) moderated relations between task value, epistemic emotions, and learning strategies.

We conducted empirical studies on indeterminate artistic movies depicting the evolution and metamorphosis of Gestalt and investigated (i) the effects of sudden perceptual insights on liking; that is, “Aesthetic Aha”-effects, (ii) the dynamics of interest before moments of insight, and (iii) the dynamics of complexity before and after moments of insight. Via the so-called Continuous Evaluation Procedure (CEP) enabling analogous evaluation in a continuous way, participants assessed the material on two aesthetic dimensions blockwise either in a gallery or a laboratory. The material’s inherent dynamics were described via assessments of liking, interest, determinacy, and surprise along with a computational analysis on the variable complexity. We identiﬁed moments of insight as peaks in determinacy and surprise. Statistically signiﬁcant changes in liking and interest demonstrated that: (i) insights increase liking, (ii) interest already increases 1500 ms before such moments of insight, supporting the idea that it is evoked by an expectation of understanding, and (iii) insights occur during increasing complexity. We propose a preliminary model of dynamics in liking and interest with regard to complexity and perceptual insight and discuss descriptions of participants’ experiences of insight.

Remembering and forgetting shows who and what one values. Indeed, memory is constitutively normative. Theoretical approaches to memory should be sensitive to this normative character. We will argue that traditional views that consider memory as the storing and retrieval of mental content, fail to consider the practices we need for telling the truth about our past. We introduce the Radically Enactive view of Cognition, or REC, as well-placed to recognize the central role of norms in remembering.

Abuse and neglect showed specific patterns, e.g., emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and physical neglect associated mostly with negative emotions, and emotional neglect predominantly with positive emotion dynamics. CM types were associated differentialy with low versus high arousal emotion dynamics (i.e sexual abuse associated with increased and emotional neglect with reduced emotion dynamics). Dissecting CM effects on adult emotion dynamics may inform theories on the ontogenesis and functioning of emotions, theories on abuse and neglect and the prevention of their developmental sequalia, and help to identify and understand well-adjusted and (dys-)functional emotional development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Myroniuk","given":"Solomiia"},{"family":"Reitsema","given":"Anne Margit"},{"family":"De Jonge","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Jeronimus","given":"Bertus F."}],"citation-key":"myroniukSpecificTypesChildhood2022","DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/cs8zv","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,16]]},"language":"en","publisher":"PsyArXiv","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Specific types of childhood abuse and neglect and profiles of adult emotion dynamics","type":"report","URL":"https://osf.io/cs8zv"},{"id":"nachshonCognitiveEmotionalChallenges2019","abstract":"Aim:\nDyslexia is characterised by a primary difficulty in both reading and\ncognitive control.

The interrelations between epistemic emotions and their interactions with affective states and metacognitive experiences are also explored. The position put forth is that epistemic emotions are triggered by cognitive states involving discrepancy, or conflict, between active schemas and incoming information, or gap in one’s knowledge. However, each of the epistemic emotions has its specific triggering conditions that differ­ entiate it from the others. Changing conditions during a cognitive endeavor impact the intensity as well as the interrelations between epistemic emotions.

The evolution of the dynamical hypothesis was driven by parallel advances in three areas. Theoretically, a deeper understanding of genetics, biology, neuroscience, and cognitive science inspired questions about how systems within each domain dynamically interact and extend their effects across spatiotemporal scales. Methodologically, more sophisticated and domain-general tools allowed researchers to discover, model, and quantify system dynamics, structure, and patterns across multiple scales to generate a more comprehensive system-level understanding of behaviors. Empirically, we can analyze a system's behavior while preserving its natural dynamics, revealing evidence that the reductionist approach leads to an incomplete understanding of the components and the overall system. Researchers have traditionally reduced a complex system into its component processes and assumed that the parts can be recombined to explain the whole. These three advances fundamentally altered our understanding of a “cognitive agent:” How their behaviors are driven by long-range coordination across multiple processes, how the interdependent and nested structure of interacting variables produces behaviors that are greater than the sum of its parts, and how environmental constraints shape adaptive yet stable behavioral patterns.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Tri D."},{"family":"Magaldino","given":"Corey M."},{"family":"Landfair","given":"Jayci T."},{"family":"Amazeen","given":"Polemnia G."},{"family":"Amazeen","given":"Eric L."}],"citation-key":"nguyenCognitiveAgentsCognitive","container-title":"Topics in Cognitive Science","DOI":"10.1111/tops.12725","ISSN":"1756-8765","issue":"n/a","language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"From Cognitive Agents to Cognitive Systems: Theoretical, Methodological, and Empirical Developments of van Gelder's (1998) “Dynamical Hypothesis”","title-short":"From Cognitive Agents to Cognitive Systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tops.12725","volume":"n/a"},{"id":"nicholsonEverythingFlowsProcessual2018","call-number":"QH331 .E85 2018","citation-key":"nicholsonEverythingFlowsProcessual2018","edition":"First edition","editor":[{"family":"Nicholson","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Dupré","given":"John"}],"event-place":"Oxford, United Kingdom","ISBN":"978-0-19-877963-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: on1007033774","number-of-pages":"386","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford, United Kingdom","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Everything flows: towards a processual philosophy of biology","title-short":"Everything flows","type":"book"},{"id":"niikawaSublimeConsciousness","abstract":"The aesthetic tradition has identified as paradigmatically sublime such objects as imposing mountains and intense storms, as well as monumental art.

In support of social memory, participants tended to remain near each other’s movement frequency after the interaction ended. Furthermore, the greater the stability of interpersonal coordination, the more similar partners’ postinteractional frequencies became. Proposing that social memory resulted from prior frequency adaptation, a model based on Haken–Kelso–Bunz (HKB) oscillators reproduced the experimental ﬁndings, even for patterns observed on individual trials. Parametric manipulations revealed multiple routes to social memory through the interplay of adaptation and other model parameters.

Findings indicate that more fluent text reading appeared by grade 4, similar to monolingual findings, and that different aspects of fluency characterized passage reading performance at different grade levels. Text fluency and oral language proficiency emerged as significant predictors of reading comprehension.","author":[{"family":"O’Brien","given":"Beth"},{"family":"Wallot","given":"Sebastian"}],"citation-key":"obrienSilentReadingFluency2016","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Frontiers in Psychology","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01265","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8,31]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Silent Reading Fluency and Comprehension in Bilingual Children","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},{"id":"obrienUsingComplexityMetrics2014","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"O’Brien","given":"Beth A."},{"family":"Wallot","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Haussmann","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Kloos","given":"Heidi"}],"citation-key":"obrienUsingComplexityMetrics2014","container-title":"Scientific Studies of Reading","container-title-short":"Scientific Studies of Reading","DOI":"10.1080/10888438.2013.862248","ISSN":"1088-8438, 1532-799X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7,4]]},"language":"en","page":"235-254","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Using Complexity Metrics to Assess Silent Reading Fluency: A Cross-Sectional Study Comparing Oral and Silent Reading","title-short":"Using Complexity Metrics to Assess Silent Reading Fluency","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10888438.2013.862248","volume":"18"},{"id":"olthofBestBothWorlds2023","abstract":"A complex systems approach to psychopathology proposes that general principles lie in the dynamic patterns of psychopathology, which are not restricted to specific psychological processes like symptoms or affect. Hence, it must be possible to find general change profiles in time series data of fully personalized questionnaires. In the current study, we examined general change profiles in personalized self-ratings and related these to four measures of treatment outcome (International Symptom Rating, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21, daily symptom severity and self-reflective capacity). We analyzed data of 404 patients with mood and/or anxiety disorders who completed daily self-ratings on personalized questionnaires during psychotherapy. For each patient, a principal component analysis was applied to the multivariate time series in order to retrieve an univariate person-specific time series. Then, using classification and regression methods, we examined these time series for the presence of general change profiles. The change profile classification yielded the following distribution of patients: no-shift (n = 55; 14%), gradual-change (n = 52; 13%), oneshift (n = 233; 58%), reversed-shift (n = 39; 10%) and multiple-shifts (n = 25; 6%). The multiple-shifts group had better treatment outcome than the no-shift group on all outcome measures. The one-shift and gradual-change group had better treatment outcome than the noshift group on respectively two and three outcome measures. Overall, this study illustrates that person-specific (idiographic) and general (nomothetic) aspects of psychopathology can be integrated in a complex systems approach to psychopathology, which may combine ‘the best of both worlds’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Olthof","given":"Merlijn"},{"family":"Hasselman","given":"Fred"},{"family":"Aas","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Lamoth","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Scholz","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Daniels-Wredenhagen","given":"Nora"},{"family":"Goldbeck","given":"Florens"},{"family":"Weinans","given":"Els"},{"family":"Strunk","given":"Guido"},{"family":"Schiepek","given":"Günter"},{"family":"Bosman","given":"Anna M.

This approach, which has already produced novel and valuable insights into the complex nature of psychopathology, often relies on repeated self-ratings of individual patients. So far it has been unknown whether such self-ratings, the presumed observables of the individual patient as a complex system, actually display complex dynamics. We examine this basic assumption of a complex systems approach to psychopathology by testing repeated self-ratings for three markers of complexity: memory, the presence of (time-varying) short- and long-range temporal correlations, regime shifts, transitions between different dynamic regimes, and, sensitive dependence on initial conditions, also known as the ‘butterfly effect’, the divergence of initially similar trajectories.\nMethods: We analysed repeated self-ratings (1,476 time points) from a single patient for the three markers of complexity using Bartels rank test, (partial) autocorrelation functions, timevarying autoregression, a non-stationarity test, change point analysis and the Sugihara-May algorithm.\nResults: Self-ratings concerning psychological states (e.g., the item ‘I feel down’) exhibited all complexity markers: time-varying short- and long-term memory, multiple regime shifts and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Unexpectedly, self-ratings concerning physical sensations (e.g., the item ‘I am hungry’) exhibited less complex dynamics and their behaviour was more similar to random variables.\nConclusions: Psychological self-ratings display complex dynamics. The presence of complexity in repeated self-ratings means that we have to acknowledge that (1) repeated selfratings yield a complex pattern of data and not a set of (nearly) independent data points, (2)","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Olthof","given":"Merlijn"},{"family":"Hasselman","given":"Fred"},{"family":"Lichtwarck-Aschoff","given":"Anna"}],"citation-key":"olthofComplexityPsychologicalSelfRatings2020","DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/fbta8","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,1]]},"language":"en","publisher":"PsyArXiv","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Complexity In Psychological Self-Ratings: Implications for research and practice","title-short":"Complexity In Psychological Self-Ratings","type":"report","URL":"https://osf.io/fbta8"},{"id":"olthofCriticalFluctuationsEarlyWarning2020","abstract":"Whereas sudden gains and losses (large shifts in symptom severity) in patients receiving psychotherapy appear abrupt and hence may seem unexpected, hypotheses from complex-systems theory suggest that sudden gains and losses are actually preceded by certain early-warning signals (EWSs).

The present study tested the hypothesis that destabilization is related to better treatment outcome.\nMethod: 328 patients who received psychotherapy for mood disorders completed daily self-ratings about their psychotherapeutic process. A continuous measure of destabilization was defined as the relative strength of the highest peak in dynamic complexity, a measure for variability and turbulence, in the self-ratings of individual patients.\nResults: Destabilization was found to be related to better treatment outcome.

At the same time the derogatory term “kitsch” was coined to contrast truly ground-breaking artistic achievements. In this article, we argue that kitsch and avant-garde art ideally represent two complementary types of aesthetic experience: a ﬂuent one that allows for immediate emotional gratiﬁcation (kitsch) and a disﬂuent one that requires cognitive elaboration (art). We make a case that preferences for the one or the other are dynamically related to a set of conﬂicting needs which constitute the basic dilemma of human attachment behavior: needs for safety and intimacy versus needs for arousal and autonomy. Based on the Zurich Model of Social Motivation we hypothesize that social distance regulation and aesthetic liking are synchronized via notions of selfefﬁcacy and autonomy: Whenever we feel safe and self-sufﬁcient, an appetence for arousal (curiosity) is likely to arise that increases our interest in unfamiliar conspeciﬁcs as well as in innovative, cognitively challenging aesthetic stimuli (art). By contrast, when we feel vulnerable and dependent, a longing for safety and relatedness (nostalgia) attracts us not only to familiar and trustworthy individuals but also to conventional aesthetic stimuli charged with positive emotions (kitsch). This theoretical framework offers an integrative perspective on dynamics of aesthetic liking in that it unites a wide variety of phenomena from anthropology, developmental, and cognitive psychology with concepts and ﬁndings from art history, sociology of art, and empirical aesthetics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ortlieb","given":"Stefan A."},{"family":"Carbon","given":"Claus-Christian"}],"citation-key":"ortliebFunctionalModelKitsch2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

Recently, an increase in mindfulness and acceptance based approaches have been utilized as a means to augment negative emotions in sport and many have suggested a link between mindfulness and flow. Thus, if mindfulness can positively influence flow, perhaps performance can also be positively affected. There has also been a need to determine optimal intervention lengths to successfully teach mindfulness practices within sports teams. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of a mindfulness training program on mindfulness scores, dispositional flow scores, and perceived stress scores within a population of Division I female collegiate gymnasts.

Speciﬁcally, the study tested whether visual exploration mediated the inﬂuence of individual differences in personality and cognitive style on aesthetic responses. Fifty-six visitors to the gallery viewed seven artworks while their eye movements were recorded. Participants rated their aesthetic response to the artworks and wrote their thoughts and impressions about each artwork. Written reports were analyzed in terms of word count and frequency of use of aesthetic descriptors. Participants completed individual difference measures, including Openness to Experience [OTE] and Need for Cognitive Closure [NFC] before viewing artworks. The results showed that (a) the duration of looking at artworks (dwell time) mediated the relationship between OTE, NFC, and word count as well as the frequency of use of aesthetic descriptors, and (b) the spatial distribution of ﬁxations mediated the relationship between both OTE and NFC and the number of words used in response to viewing artworks. The results indicate that visual exploration plays a functional role in the experience of artworks in a real gallery setting, and that visual exploration is a mechanism through which OTE and NFC inﬂuence aesthetic responses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Palumbo","given":"Letizia"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Neil Richard"},{"family":"Trawiński","given":"Tobiasz"},{"family":"Kass","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Metelmann","given":"Andrea Caroline"},{"family":"Bari","given":"Rai Samar Ghulam"},{"family":"Donnelly","given":"Nicholas"}],"citation-key":"palumboVisualExplorationMediates2023","container-title":"Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts","container-title-short":"Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts","DOI":"10.1037/aca0000529","ISSN":"1931-390X, 1931-3896","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,2]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Visual exploration mediates the influence of personal traits on responses to artworks in an art gallery setting.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/aca0000529"},{"id":"parisDevelopmentChildrensReading2015","author":[{"family":"Paris","given":"Scott G."},{"family":"Hamilton","given":"Ellen E."}],"citation-key":"parisDevelopmentChildrensReading2015","container-title":"Handbook of research on reading comprehension","edition":"1. publ","editor":[{"family":"Israel","given":"Susan E."},{"family":"Duffy","given":"Gerald G."}],"event-place":"New York, NY","ISBN":"978-0-8058-6200-3 978-1-4106-1585-5 978-0-8058-6201-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"56-77","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"New York, NY","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"The Development of Children’s Reading Comprehension","type":"chapter"},{"id":"paulMutabilityCharismaLeadership2002","abstract":"This article reveals the mutability of charisma by tracing changes in the conceptualization of charisma throughout the history of leadership research.

The mutability of charisma has extended charismatic leadership theory from the domain of theology to multiple facets of the organizational sciences. Shifting conceptualizations of charisma that emphasize different elements have facilitated the study of leader traits, leader behaviors, situational contingencies, leader and organizational communications, and organizational cultures. These pluralistic conceptualizations of leadership and charisma have broadened our understanding of charismatic leadership.

Many of the established methods of analyzing interpersonal synchrony are costly and time-consuming; the study of bodily synchrony has been especially laborious, traditionally requiring researchers to hand-code movement frame by frame. Because of this, researchers have been searching for more efficient alternatives for decades. Recently, some researchers (e.g., Nagaoka & Komori (IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems, 91(6), 1634–1640, 2008); Ramseyer & Tschacher, 2008) have applied computer science and computer vision techniques to create frame-differencing methods (FDMs) to simplify analyses. In this article, we provide a detailed presentation of one such FDM, created by modifying and adding to existing FDMs. The FDM that we present requires little programming experience or specialized equipment: Only a few lines of MATLAB code are required to execute an automated analysis of interpersonal synchrony. We provide sample code and demonstrate its use with an analysis of brief, friendly conversations; using linear mixed-effects models, the measure of interpersonal synchrony was found to be significantly predicted by time lag (p < .001) and by the interaction between time lag and measures of interpersonal liking (p < .001). This pattern of results fits with existing literature on synchrony. We discuss the current limitations and future directions for FDMs, including their use as part of a larger methodology for capturing and analyzing multimodal interaction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Paxton","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Dale","given":"Rick"}],"citation-key":"paxtonFramedifferencingMethodsMeasuring2013","container-title":"Behavior Research Methods","container-title-short":"Behav Res","DOI":"10.3758/s13428-012-0249-2","ISSN":"1554-3528","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"329-343","source":"Springer Link","title":"Frame-differencing methods for measuring bodily synchrony in conversation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-012-0249-2","volume":"45"},{"id":"paxtonPredictionsMiscommunicationVerbal2021","abstract":"Purpose\nThe purpose of the current study was to examine the lexical and pragmatic factors that may contribute to turn-by-turn failures in communication (i.e., miscommunication) that arise regularly in interactive communication.\n\nMethod\nUsing a corpus from a collaborative dyadic building task, we investigated what differentiated successful from unsuccessful communication and potential factors associated with the choice to provide greater lexical information to a conversation partner.\n\nResults\nWe found that more successful dyads' language tended to be associated with greater lexical density, lower ambiguity, and fewer questions.

This new emphasis on modeling has often become the basis for our theoretical understanding of human interaction with art. Models also often deﬁne areas of focus and hypotheses for new empirical research, and are increasingly important for connecting psychological theory to discussions of the brain. However, models are often made by different researchers, with quite different emphases or visual styles. Inputs and psychological outcomes may be differently considered, or can be under-reported with regards to key functional components. Thus, we may lose the major theoretical improvements and ability for comparison that can be had with models. To begin addressing this, this paper presents a theoretical assessment, comparison, and new articulation of a selection of key contemporary cognitive or information-processing-based approaches detailing the mechanisms underlying the viewing of art. We review six major models in contemporary psychological aesthetics. We in turn present redesigns of these models using a uniﬁed visual form, in some cases making additions or creating new models where none had previously existed. We also frame these approaches in respect to their targeted outputs (e.g., emotion, appraisal, physiological reaction) and their strengths within a more general framework of early, intermediate, and later processing stages. This is used as a basis for general comparison and discussion of implications and future directions for modeling, and for theoretically understanding our engagement with visual art.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Pelowski","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Markey","given":"Patrick S."},{"family":"Lauring","given":"Jon O."},{"family":"Leder","given":"Helmut"}],"citation-key":"pelowskiVisualizingImpactArt2016","container-title":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

Analysis of heart rate dynamics by methods based on chaos theory and nonlinear system theory has gained recent interest. This interest is based on observations suggesting that the mechanisms involved in cardiovascular regulation likely interact with each other in a nonlinear way. Furthermore, recent observational studies suggest that some indexes describing nonlinear heart rate dynamics, such as fractal scaling exponents, may provide more powerful prognostic information than the traditional heart rate variability indexes. In particular, the short-term fractal scaling exponent measured by the detrended fluctuation analysis method has predicted fatal cardiovascular events in various populations. Approximate entropy, a nonlinear index of heart rate dynamics, that describes the complexity of RR interval behavior, has provided information on the vulnerability to atrial fibrillation. Many other nonlinear indexes, e.g., Lyapunov exponent and correlation dimensions, also give information on the characteristics of heart rate dynamics, but their clinical utility is not well established. Although concepts of chaos theory, fractal mathematics, and complexity measures of heart rate behavior in relation to cardiovascular physiology or various cardiovascular events are still far away from clinical medicine, they are a fruitful area for future research to expand our knowledge concerning the behavior of cardiovascular oscillations in normal healthy conditions as well as in disease states.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Perkiömäki","given":"Juha"},{"family":"Mäkikallio","given":"Timo"},{"family":"Huikuri","given":"Heikki"}],"citation-key":"perkiomakiFractalComplexityMeasures2005","container-title":"Clinical and Experimental Hypertension","container-title-short":"Clinical & Expt.

Here, we used a strength-dependent perturbative framework to provide a causal mechanistic description of how human brain function is perched at the delicate balance between fluctuation and oscillation. Applying local strength-dependent perturbations and subsequently measuring the perturbative complexity index clearly demonstrates that the overall balance of brain dynamics is shifted towards fluctuations for providing much needed flexibility. Importantly, stimulation in the fluctuation regime modulates specific resting state network, thus providing a mechanistic explanation of experimentally reported brain dynamics. Furthermore, this framework generates specific, testable empirical predictions for human stimulation studies using strength-dependent rather than constant perturbation. Overall, the strength-dependent perturbative framework demonstrates how the human brain is poised on the edge of criticality, between fluctuations to oscillations, allowing for maximal flexibility.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Perl","given":"Yonatan Sanz"},{"family":"Escrichs","given":"Anira"},{"family":"Tagliazucchi","given":"Enzo"},{"family":"Kringelbach","given":"Morten L."},{"family":"Deco","given":"Gustavo"}],"citation-key":"perlEdgeCriticalityStrengthdependent2021","DOI":"10.1101/2021.09.23.461520","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,24]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Neuroscience","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On the edge of criticality: strength-dependent perturbation unveils delicate balance between fluctuation and oscillation in brain dynamics","title-short":"On the edge of criticality","type":"report","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2021.09.23.461520"},{"id":"picarraSearchingNavigatingRecommending2022","abstract":"Movies offer viewers a broad range of emotional experiences, providing entertainment, and meaning.

This article aims to provide such a bridge.

Pieces of art are not only present in museums, but also in advertisements and on products. This presence has proven its effectiveness in terms of how the product and/or how the brand are perceived. Art’s effect on product evaluation is called the art infusion effect, as the qualities of art are transferred onto the product. Even though there are various studies on art infusion, little is known about art’s impact when displayed on promotional event posters. A between-subjects experiment with 158 participants was conducted in order to see if events advertised on posters that include art are more positively evaluated than events advertised on posters that do not contain art. Moreover, it was examined if people have a higher general aesthetic experience (moderated by openness) when confronted with the art posters vs. the non-art ones, and if this aesthetic experience mediates event evaluation. The findings show that, firstly, there is no difference in general aesthetic experience when seeing posters with or without art. Secondly, contrary to the expected results, people evaluated the events seen on posters that did not contain classical art more positively. Finally, when taking all the variables into account, the complete model showed no significant moderated mediation. Summarizing, it is suggested that for event promotions posters should include photos rather than classical art. Further research could be done in relation to art infusion in event promotion, as the event type and the context in which the poster is placed both matter. Limitations, implications and suggestions for further research are also discussed.","author":[{"family":"Pintilie","given":"Ioana"}],"citation-key":"pintilieEventEvaluationPromotional","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Event Evaluation through Promotional Posters: Art Infusion in the Context of Dance Events","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"pollatsekChapter18Modeling2003","abstract":"This chapter describes models of eye movements while people read text. All of the models have the core assumption that the primary “engine” that drives the eyes forward on text is the serial identification of words in text. However, the relationship among the identification of a word, the forward movement of attention, and the program to fixate the subsequent word is not completely straightforward. Silent reading is one of the most important skills humans master and it is certainly one of the most frequent complex cognitive acts most adults perform. A powerful tool for understanding reading is examining the pattern of eye movements while people silently read text for meaning. It was believed that little could be learned from eye movements in reading because it was hypothesized that the cognitive acts in reading were too slow to be responsive to the system that was generating eye movements three to four times a second. However, it is now clear that the moment-to-moment pattern of eye movements is responsive to aspects of the meaning of the text—such as the frequency of a word in the language—and therefore cognitive acts—such as recognizing a word—do influence the behavior of the eyes in a moment-to-moment fashion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Pollatsek","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Reichle","given":"Erik D."},{"family":"Rayner","given":"Keith"}],"citation-key":"pollatsekChapter18Modeling2003","container-title":"The Mind's Eye","DOI":"10.1016/B978-044451020-4/50021-9","editor":[{"family":"Hyönä","given":"J."},{"family":"Radach","given":"R."},{"family":"Deubel","given":"H."}],"event-place":"Amsterdam","ISBN":"978-0-444-51020-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",1,1]]},"page":"361-390","publisher":"North-Holland","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Chapter 18 - Modeling Eye Movements in Reading: Extensions of the E–Z Reader Model","title-short":"Chapter 18 - Modeling Eye Movements in Reading","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444510204500219"},{"id":"popovaEnactivismEcologicalPsychology2020","abstract":"This paper considers some foundational concepts in ecological psychology and in enactivism, and traces their developments from their historical roots to current preoccupations.

Rather than pointing to differences in domains of interest for the respective approaches, and restating possible divisions of labor between them in research in the cognitive and psychological sciences, we call for a deeper analysis of the role of embodiment in agency that we also undertake. Awareness of the differences that exist in the respective frameworks and their consequences, we argue, may lead to overcoming some current divisions of responsibility, and contribute to a more comprehensive and complementary way of dealing with a broader range of theoretical and practical concerns. While providing some examples of domains, such as social cognition and art reception, in which we can observe the relative usefulness and potential integration of the theoretical and methodological resources from the two approaches, we demonstrate that such deeper synergy is not only possible but also beginning to emerge. Such complementarity, as we envisage, conceives of ecological psychology that allows felt experience as a crucial dynamical element in the explanations and models that it produces, and of an enactive approach that takes into consideration the ubiquitous presence of rich directly perceived relations among variables arising from enactments in the social and physical world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Popova","given":"Yanna B."},{"family":"Rączaszek-Leonardi","given":"Joanna"}],"citation-key":"popovaEnactivismEcologicalPsychology2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

This article deals with a specific aspect of temporal experience as it relates to reading and experiencing narrative fiction. Within an enactive understanding of human cognition, we propose a view of literary reading as a process of participatory sense-making between a reader and a storyteller. The enactive theory of participatory sense-making maintains that agents, by enacting their own sense-making, directly and partially constitute the sense-making of other agents. Sense-makers in interaction navigate two orders of normativity: their own and that of the interaction itself. Linguistic sense-making (languaging) opens up further possibilities for understanding complex spatially and temporally distributed forms of social interactions such as narrative interactions. Reading a narrative is one such example of mutually constituted navigation between an interaction dynamic and interactors’ sense-making. The reader completes and co-authors emergent textual meaning and a textually emerging storyteller guides and anticipates the multiple temporal displacements, realized linguistically, that a reader has to experience in the process of reading. We explore the participatory structure of a narrative through its temporal unfolding and the specific, non-linear nature of the temporal dynamics of interacting with a storytelling agency. In particular, narrative interactions are seen as modulations in the pacing of a given narrative’s unfolding. It is suggested that the reader’s enactment of such temporally realized pacings constitutes a better description of narrative immersion than its traditional understanding as a simulation of spatial situatedness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Popova","given":"Yanna"},{"family":"Cuffari","given":"Elena"}],"citation-key":"popovaTemporalitySensemakingNarrative2018","container-title":"Cognitive Semiotics","DOI":"10.1515/cogsem-2018-0007","ISSN":"2235-2066","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,1]]},"language":"en","license":"De Gruyter expressly reserves the right to use all content for commercial text and data mining within the meaning of Section 44b of the German Copyright Act.","publisher":"De Gruyter Mouton","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"Temporality of sense-making in narrative interactions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/cogsem-2018-0007/html?casa_token=MzRQV1715eEAAAAA%3ASjV2cthCNObb6IfxKMnaFtpBTl8ZnynkqriLeAcIate-WlJR2R5WQuE8p-mu97b3vkX1ufg05g","volume":"11"},{"id":"porgesPolyvagalPerspective2007","abstract":"The polyvagal theory introduced a new perspective relating autonomic function to behavior, that included an appreciation of the autonomic nervous system as a ‘‘system,’’ the identiﬁcation of neural circuits involved in the regulation of autonomic state, and an interpretation of autonomic reactivity as adaptive within the context of the phylogeny of the vertebrate autonomic nervous system.

The study of feelings of safety has been an elusive construct that has historically been dependent upon subjectivity. Acknowledging that feelings of safety have a measurable underlying neurophysiological substrate would shift investigations of feelings of safety from a subjective to an objective science. Polyvagal Theory provides an innovative scientiﬁc perspective to study feelings of safety that incorporates an understanding of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. This perspective identiﬁes neural circuits that downregulate neural regulation of threat reactions and functionally neutralize defensive strategies via neural circuits communicating cues of safety that enable feelings of safety to support interpersonal accessibility and homeostatic functions. Basically, when humans feel safe, their nervous systems support the homeostatic functions of health, growth, and restoration, while they simultaneously become accessible to others without feeling or expressing threat and vulnerability. Feelings of safety reﬂect a core fundamental process that has enabled humans to survive through the opportunistic features of trusting social engagements that have coregulatory capacities to mitigate metabolically costly defense reactions. Through the study of neural development and phylogeny, we can extract foundational principles and their underlying mechanisms through which the autonomic nervous system leads to feelings of safety and opportunities to co-regulate. Several principles highlight the validity of a science of safety that when implemented in societal institutions, ranging from healthcare to education, would enhance health, sociality, and lead to greater productivity, creativity, and a sense of wellbeing. By respecting our need to feel safe as a biological imperative linked to survival, we respect our phylogenetic heritage and elevate sociality as a neuromodulator that functionally provides the scientiﬁc validation for a societal focus on promoting opportunities to experience feelings of safety and co-regulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Porges","given":"Stephen W."}],"citation-key":"porgesPolyvagalTheoryScience2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

However, humans also gesture along with the rhythm of speaking, which is amenable to a non-representational perspective. Such a perspective centers on the phenomenon of vocal-entangled gestures and builds on evidence showing that when an upper limb with a certain mass decelerates/accelerates sufficiently, it yields impulses on the body that cascade in various ways into the respiratory–vocal system. It entails a physical entanglement between body motions, respiration, and vocal activities. It is shown that vocal-entangled gestures are realized in infant vocal–motor babbling before any representational use of gesture develops. Similarly, an overview is given of vocal-entangled processes in non-human animals. They can frequently be found in rats, bats, birds, and a range of other species that developed even earlier in the phylogenetic tree.

The main contention is that extended cognition relies on a unitary brain-body-tool system showing the expected signatures of interaction-dominance reﬂected in a multifractal behavior. This might be particularly relevant when it comes to understanding how the brain is able to embody a tool to perform a task. Here we applied the multifractal formalism to the dynamics of hand movement while one was performing a computer task (the herding task) using a mouse or its own hand as a tool to move an object on the screen. We applied a focus-based multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation analysis to acceleration time series. Then, multifractal nonlinearity was assessed by comparing original series to a ﬁnite set of surrogates obtained after Iterated Amplitude Adjusted Fourier transformation, a method that removes nonlinear multiscale dependencies while preserving the linear structure of the time series. Both hand and mouse task execution demonstrated multifractal nonlinearity, a typical form of across-scales interactivity in cognitive control. In addition, a wider multifractal spectrum was observed in mouse condition, which might highlight a richer set of interactions when the cognitive system is extended to the embodied mouse. We conclude that the emergence of multifractal nonlinearity from a brain-body-tool system pleads for recent theories of radical tool embodiment. Multifractal nonlinearity may be a promising metric to appreciate how physical objects—but also virtual tools and potentially prosthetics—are efﬁciently embodied by the brain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Pratviel","given":"Yvan"},{"family":"Deschodt-Arsac","given":"Veronique"},{"family":"Larrue","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Arsac","given":"Laurent M."}],"citation-key":"pratvielToolEmbodimentReflected2022","container-title":"Fractal and Fractional","container-title-short":"Fractal Fract","DOI":"10.3390/fractalfract6050240","ISSN":"2504-3110","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,26]]},"language":"en","page":"240","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Tool Embodiment Is Reflected in Movement Multifractal Nonlinearity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2504-3110/6/5/240","volume":"6"},{"id":"prokhorovInterbeatIntervalVariability2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Prokhorov","given":"M.

Data Sources: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Ovid interface. Main Results: ADHD can have many effects on athletes and sports participation. Exercise has positive benefits on ADHD behaviors and players’ attitudes. Athletes with ADHD can have worsened ADHD symptoms after concussions. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a modifier of return to play; baseline ADHD symptoms should be used to guide management. Management should include medications, behavioral/psychosocial therapy, and academic accommodations. Behavioral therapy combined with medication is superior to behavioral treatment alone. Sustained exercise as ADHD treatment should be considered mainstay in management. Sports can increase thermogenic effects of stimulants, heat injury, and cardiac arrhythmias. Increased aggressiveness, improved pain tolerance, and decreased sense of fatigue are some attributes of stimulants that are presumed to impart some advantage to athletes, but evidence is uncertain. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medications may lead to myocardial infarctions, cerebrovascular accidents, paranoid psychoses, seizures, insomnia, tremors, anxiety, hypertension, and death. Conclusions: Athletes’ performance and quality of life can be negatively affected by ADHD. Risks exist for those who take ADHD medications. More research is needed on the implications ADHD may have in specific sports, and on possible advantages of medication use.

Despite broad agreement on its importance, empirical studies assessing nonverbal behavior in counseling and psychotherapy are relatively scarce and often limited to few cases. One restraining factor may be the resources needed when assessing nonverbal behavior. Movement dynamics are an exemplary aspect of nonverbal behavior that can be captured with computer vision – a discipline concerned with the automated analysis of footage captured on video. One of the simplest methods requiring no special detectors, devices, or markers on patients or therapists is based on the assessment of differences in sequences of pictures (frames) found in video-recordings. Algorithms of so-called frame-differencing methods may be implemented on commonly available computers, and they provide a good, straightforward assessment of e.g. patient's and therapist's movement dynamics in counseling- and therapy sessions. Frame-differencing methods in psychology date back 36 years, but their use in counseling- and psychotherapy research is only recently gaining momentum. In this introductory article, the use of one specific application suitable for the assessment of human motion from archival video material is presented. Motion energy analysis (MEA) is a procedure particularly appropriate for clinicians and researchers who have access to recordings of sessions or who wish to record their own video material. Focusing on the phenomenon of nonverbal synchrony – the coordination of movement between patient and therapist, we provide a step-by-step demonstration of the stages involved in a successful application of MEA in psychotherapy research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Ramseyer","given":"Fabian T."}],"citation-key":"ramseyerMotionEnergyAnalysis2020","container-title":"Journal of Counseling Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Counseling Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/cou0000407","ISSN":"1939-2168, 0022-0167","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7]]},"language":"en","page":"536-549","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Motion energy analysis (MEA): A primer on the assessment of motion from video.","title-short":"Motion energy analysis (MEA)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/cou0000407","volume":"67"},{"id":"raneyUsingEyeMovements2014","abstract":"The present article describes how to use eye tracking methodologies to study the cognitive processes involved in text comprehension. Measuring eye movements during reading is one of the most precise methods for measuring moment-by-moment (online) processing demands during text comprehension. Cognitive processing demands are reflected by several aspects of eye movement behavior, such as fixation duration, number of fixations, and number of regressions (returning to prior parts of a text). Important properties of eye tracking equipment that researchers need to consider are described, including how frequently the eye position is measured (sampling rate), accuracy of determining eye position, how much head movement is allowed, and ease of use. Also described are properties of stimuli that influence eye movements that need to be controlled in studies of text comprehension, such as the position, frequency, and length of target words. Procedural recommendations related to preparing the participant, setting up and calibrating the equipment, and running a study are given. Representative results are presented to illustrate how data can be evaluated.

Researchers often talk about a “model of reading” when talking about only one aspect of the reading process (for example, models of word identification are often referred to as “models of reading”). Here, we review prominent models that are designed to account for (1) word identification, (2) syntactic parsing, (3) discourse representations, and (4) how certain aspects of language processing (e.g., word identification), in conjunction with other constraints (e g., limited visual acuity, saccadic error, etc.), guide readers’ eyes. Unfortunately, it is the case that these various models addressing specific aspects of the reading process seldom make contact with models dealing with other aspects of reading. Thus, for example, the models of word identification seldom make contact with models of eye movement control, and vice versa. While this may be unfortunate in some ways, it is quite understandable in other ways because reading itself is a very complex process. We discuss prototypical models of aspects of the reading process in the order mentioned above. We do not review all possible models, but rather focus on those we view as being representative and most highly recognized.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Rayner","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Reichle","given":"Erik D."}],"citation-key":"raynerModelsReadingProcess2010","container-title":"Wiley interdisciplinary reviews.

Speed reading has been an intriguing concept for decades, at least since Evelyn Wood introduced her Reading Dynamics training program in 1959. It has recently increased in popularity, with speed-reading apps and technologies being introduced for smartphones and digital devices. The current article reviews what the scientific community knows about the reading process—a great deal—and discusses the implications of the research findings for potential students of speed-reading training programs or purchasers of speed-reading apps. The research shows that there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. It is unlikely that readers will be able to double or triple their reading speeds (e.g., from around 250 to 500–750 words per minute) while still being able to understand the text as well as if they read at normal speed. If a thorough understanding of the text is not the reader’s goal, then speed reading or skimming the text will allow the reader to get through it faster with moderate comprehension. The way to maintain high comprehension and get through text faster is to practice reading and to become a more skilled language user (e.g., through increased vocabulary). This is because language skill is at the heart of reading speed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Rayner","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Schotter","given":"Elizabeth R."},{"family":"Masson","given":"Michael E.

All of these approaches share the notion that leader charisma depends on an explicit interaction between leader and follower. With the present review paper, we extend extant theorizing by arguing that charisma is additionally informed by embodied signals that ﬂow directly from either the leader or the immediate environment. We introduce the embodiment perspective on human perception and describe its utility for theoretically understanding the charismatic effect. Correspondingly, we review studies that show which concrete embodied cues can support the charismatic effect.

Positive mood initially led to faster localisation of appealing compared to unappealing stimuli, while an advantage for appealing over unappealing stimuli emerged over time in negative mood participants. The findings are compatible with the idea that appealing stimuli may be inherently rewarding, with mood temporarily gating any rewarding effects that aesthetic appeal might have on performance.

I conclude by discussing emerging issues and approaches to teaching metacognition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Rhodes","given":"Matthew G."}],"citation-key":"rhodesMetacognition2019","container-title":"Teaching of Psychology","DOI":"10.1177/0098628319834381","ISSN":"0098-6283","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"168-175","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Metacognition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0098628319834381","volume":"46"},{"id":"richardsonComplexDynamicalSystems2014","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Richardson","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Dale","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Marsh","given":"Kerry L."}],"citation-key":"richardsonComplexDynamicalSystems2014","container-title":"Handbook of Research Methods in Social and Personality Psychology","DOI":"10.1017/CBO9780511996481.015","edition":"2","editor":[{"family":"Reis","given":"Harry T."},{"family":"Judd","given":"Charles M."}],"ISBN":"978-0-511-99648-1 978-1-107-01177-9 978-1-107-60075-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",2,24]]},"language":"en","page":"253-282","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Complex Dynamical Systems in Social and Personality Psychology: Theory, Modeling, and Analysis","title-short":"Complex Dynamical Systems in Social and Personality Psychology","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9780511996481%23c01177-3290/type/book_part"},{"id":"richardsonLookingUnderstandCoupling2005","abstract":"We investigated the coupling between a speaker’s and a listener’s eye movements.

In tutorial fashion, the authors review the concepts of variability and determinism with respect to postural and rhythmic movements. Study of the variability of those behaviors has revealed crucial features suggestive of underlying mechanisms and control, such as particular blends of noise and determinism (piecewise determinism).

In this overview of transnational differences, we document a number of positive predictors of international differences in student competence, including the amount of preschool education, student discipline, quantity of education, attendance at additional schools, early tracking, the use of centralized exams and high-stakes tests, and adult educational attainment.

Participants were asked to indicate the degree to which they enjoyed various film genres, and then were given a brief Big Five Factor personality test. Notable correlations were found between the personality factor of extraversion and the genres of comedy and romance, and between the factor of openness to experience and the genres of documentary and science fiction. Significant gender differences were also observed, with women rating the genres of drama and romance higher than men, and men rating action and science fiction higher than women. These differences likely explain some of the correlations between traits and film preference in this study, as the sample was predominantly female.

This paper describes the results of experiments designed to discover potential correlates of such judgments, in what speakers say and the way that they say it. We present results of two parallel experiments in which subjective judgments of charisma in spoken and in transcribed American political speech were analyzed with respect to the acoustic and prosodic (where applicable) and lexico-syntactic characteristics of the speech being assessed. While we ﬁnd that there is considerable disagreement among subjects on how the speakers of each token are ranked, we also ﬁnd that subjects appear to share a functional deﬁnition of charisma, in terms of other personal characteristics we asked them to rank speakers by. We also ﬁnd certain acoustic, prosodic, and lexico-syntactic characteristics that correlate signiﬁcantly with perceptions of charisma. Finally, by comparing the responses to spoken vs. transcribed stimuli, we attempt to distinguish between the contributions of ‘‘what is said” and ‘‘how it is said” with respect to charisma judgments.

We used wearable devices to capture data on body posture, autonomic responses and spatial proximity to investigate how postural alignment and shared arousal intertwine during this ritual. The findings reveal a dual process at play: postural alignment appears to be more localized, with worshippers synchronizing their movements with their nearest neighbours, while physiological alignment operates on a broader scale, primarily driven by the central role of the religious leader.

The sharedness of stress appraisals has been elaborately studied in social groups such as couples, families, friends, and small communities. However, insights into teams have been rather limited. Keeping in mind the effects of stress on teams, it is essential to understand how team stress will form in teams over time. Seven dyad teams were observed during a 13-min flight simulation task. Researchers used the course of action analysis to reconstruct and distinguish one top-down (i.e., the shared stress configuration) and three bottom-up configuration types (i.e., the mimic, interactive, and independent stress configurations). Our findings suggest that especially the bottom-up influence of social stressors plays an important role in the team stress, especially when members verbally interact with one another. This proposes that, in comparison to the influence of contextual factors, diverse empathic processes play a more distinct role in the formation of team stress than initially thought in teams. This article also intends to illustrate how team stress can be studied over time, and how this type of output can contribute to a more fine-grained theoretical understanding of how team stress forms over time in teams. Last, it also provides some basic practical insights into the design of stress feedback systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Sassenus","given":"Steffi"},{"family":"Van Den Bossche","given":"Piet"},{"family":"Poels","given":"Karolien"}],"citation-key":"sassenusWhenStressBecomes2022","container-title":"Cognition, Technology & Work","container-title-short":"Cogn Tech Work","DOI":"10.1007/s10111-022-00698-z","ISSN":"1435-5558, 1435-5566","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11]]},"language":"en","page":"537-556","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"When stress becomes shared: exploring the emergence of team stress","title-short":"When stress becomes shared","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10111-022-00698-z","volume":"24"},{"id":"satamaPursuingPerfectionRelationality2022","abstract":"This study investigates the relational dynamics of embodied agency in the empirical context of ballet. Drawing on 15 ethnographic and 6 photo-elicitation interviews with professional dancers from the Finnish National Ballet, this study analyses the ways in which ballet dancers negotiate their agency in relation to other agents in their everyday work. We show how ballet dancers have to balance between satisfying the needs of the invisible gaze through different layers of relationality, on the one hand, and aiming to create room for their intimate, embodied experiences on the other. This study contributes to the existing knowledge on agency at the workplace by illustrating how it is grounded in the body in relational ways. By furthering the phenomenological understanding of subject formation as a form of intersubjectivity, this study shows how the working self is always relationally constructed, open to ambiguity and, sometimes, ‘caught between’ achieving agency and the objectifying scrutiny of the self and others between the visible onstage and hidden backstage. Consequently, this study offers in-depth insights into and parallels for intersubjective development in organisations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Satama","given":"Suvi"},{"family":"Huopalainen","given":"Astrid"}],"citation-key":"satamaPursuingPerfectionRelationality2022","container-title":"Organization","container-title-short":"Organization","DOI":"10.1177/13505084221124190","ISSN":"1350-5084, 1461-7323","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,18]]},"language":"en","page":"135050842211241","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Pursuing perfection through relationality: Studying the intersubjective dynamics of embodied agency in ballet","title-short":"Pursuing perfection through relationality","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13505084221124190"},{"id":"scarpelliAdvancesUnderstandingRelationship2019","abstract":"Starting from the consolidated relationship between sleep and cognition, we reviewed the available literature on the association between Attention Deﬁcit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and sleep.

We included the polysomnographic studies published in the last 15 years. The results of macrostructural parameters are mixed. Almost half of the 18 selected investigations did not ﬁnd diﬀerences between sleep architecture of children with ADHD and controls. Five studies observed that children with ADHD show a longer Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep duration than controls. Eight studies included microstructural measures. Remarkable alterations in sleep microstructure of ADHD are related to slow wave activity (SWA) and theta oscillations, respectively, during Non-REM (NREM) and REM sleep. Speciﬁcally, some studies found higher SWA in the ADHD group than controls. Similarly, higher theta activity appears to be detrimental for memory performance and inhibitory control in ADHD. These patterns could be interpreted as a maturational delay in ADHD. Also, the increased amount of these activities would be consistent with the hypothesis that the poor sleep could imply a chronic sleep deprivation in children with ADHD, which in turn could aﬀect their cognitive functioning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Scarpelli","given":"Serena"},{"family":"Gorgoni","given":"Maurizio"},{"family":"D’Atri","given":"Aurora"},{"family":"Reda","given":"Flaminia"},{"family":"De Gennaro","given":"Luigi"}],"citation-key":"scarpelliAdvancesUnderstandingRelationship2019","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","container-title-short":"JCM","DOI":"10.3390/jcm8101737","ISSN":"2077-0383","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,19]]},"language":"en","page":"1737","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Advances in Understanding the Relationship between Sleep and Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/8/10/1737","volume":"8"},{"id":"schindlerMeasuringAestheticEmotions2017","abstract":"Aesthetic perception and judgement are not merely cognitive processes, but also involve feelings. Therefore, the empirical study of these experiences requires conceptualization and measurement of aesthetic emotions. Despite the long-standing interest in such emotions, we still lack an assessment tool to capture the broad range of emotions that occur in response to the perceived aesthetic appeal of stimuli. Elicitors of aesthetic emotions are not limited to the arts in the strict sense, but extend to design, built environments, and nature. In this article, we describe the development of a questionnaire that is applicable across many of these domains: the Aesthetic Emotions Scale (AESTHEMOS). Drawing on theoretical accounts of aesthetic emotions and an extensive review of extant measures of aesthetic emotions within specific domains such as music, literature, film, painting, advertisements, design, and architecture, we propose a framework for studying aesthetic emotions. The AESTHEMOS, which is based on this framework, contains 21 subscales with two items each, that are designed to assess the emotional signature of responses to stimuli’s perceived aesthetic appeal in a highly differentiated manner. These scales cover prototypical aesthetic emotions (e.g., the feeling of beauty, being moved, fascination, and awe), epistemic emotions (e.g., interest and insight), and emotions indicative of amusement (humor and joy). In addition, the AESTHEMOS subscales capture both the activating (energy and vitality) and the calming (relaxation) effects of aesthetic experiences, as well as negative emotions that may contribute to aesthetic displeasure (e.g., the feeling of ugliness, boredom, and confusion).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Schindler","given":"Ines"},{"family":"Hosoya","given":"Georg"},{"family":"Menninghaus","given":"Winfried"},{"family":"Beermann","given":"Ursula"},{"family":"Wagner","given":"Valentin"},{"family":"Eid","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Scherer","given":"Klaus R."}],"citation-key":"schindlerMeasuringAestheticEmotions2017","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0178899","editor":[{"family":"Kret","given":"Mariska E."}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,5]]},"language":"en","page":"e0178899","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Measuring aesthetic emotions: A review of the literature and a new assessment tool","title-short":"Measuring aesthetic emotions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0178899","volume":"12"},{"id":"schinkelOrderPatternsRecurrence2007","abstract":"Recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis (RQA) is an established tool for data analysis in various behavioural sciences.

To date, studies have focused mainly on interpersonal coordination, but complexity matching may generalize to interacting networks within individuals. The present study examined complexity matching in a double, coordinated Fitts’ perceptual-motor task with comparable individual and dyadic conditions. Participants alternated touching targets with their left and right hands in the individual condition, or analogously with the left hand of one partner and the right hand of another in the dyadic condition. In Experiment 1, response coupling was manipulated by making targets drift either randomly or contingently based on prior responses. Here, drift refers to the variability in the target movements between response locations. Long-range correlations in time series of inter-response intervals exhibited complexity matching between the left and right hands of dyads and individuals. Response coupling was necessary for complexity matching in dyads but not individuals. When response coupling was absent in the dyadic condition, the degree of complexity matching was significantly reduced. Experiment 2 showed that the effect of coupling was due to interactions between left and right responses. Results also showed a weak, negative relationship between complexity matching and performance as measured by total response time. In conclusion, principles and measures of complexity matching apply similarly within and between individuals, and perceptual-motor performance can be facilitated by loose response coupling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Schloesser","given":"Daniel S."},{"family":"Kello","given":"Christopher T."},{"family":"Marmelat","given":"Vivien"}],"citation-key":"schloesserComplexityMatchingCoordination2019","container-title":"Human Movement Science","container-title-short":"Human Movement Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.humov.2019.04.010","ISSN":"01679457","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8]]},"language":"en","page":"258-272","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Complexity matching and coordination in individual and dyadic performance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167945718308042","volume":"66"},{"id":"schmeisserFractalAnalysisEye2001","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmeisser","given":"Elmar T."},{"family":"Mcdonough","given":"J.

Pairs of participants enacted knock–knock jokes and times series of their bodily activity were recorded. Coherence and relative phase analyses were used to evaluate the synchronization of bodily rhythms for the whole trial as well as at the subsidiary time scales of the whole joke, the setup of the punch line, the two-person exchange and the utterance. The analyses revealed greater than chance entrainment of the joke teller’s and joke responder’s movements at all time scales and that the relative phasing of the teller’s movements led those of the responder at the longer time scales. Moreover, this entrainment was greater when visual information about the partner’s movements was present but was decreased particularly at the shorter time scales when explicit gesturing in telling the joke was performed.

Findings from a recent longitudinal study are presented that demonstrate developmental links between early ToM and subsequent declarative metacognitive knowledge, mainly mediated by language competencies. The relevant literature further indicates that developmental trends in declarative and procedural metacognitive knowledge clearly differ. Whereas the findings for declarative metacognitive knowledge show steady improvement through childhood and adolescence, mainly due to increases in knowledge about strategies, the results are not similarly clear-cut for procedural metacognition. Age trends observed for this component of metacognition are significant for self-control activities but not pronounced for monitoring abilities. These findings have important implications for education, emphasizing the role of strategy training procedures in different instructional domains and illustrating teachers’ potential impact on the improvement of monitoring and control processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Schneider","given":"Wolfgang"}],"citation-key":"schneiderDevelopmentMetacognitiveKnowledge2008","container-title":"Mind, Brain, and Education","DOI":"10.1111/j.1751-228X.2008.00041.x","ISSN":"1751-228X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2008 the Author Journal Compilation © 2008 International Mind, Brain, and Education Society and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","page":"114-121","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Development of Metacognitive Knowledge in Children and Adolescents: Major Trends and Implications for Education","title-short":"The Development of Metacognitive Knowledge in Children and Adolescents","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-228X.2008.00041.x","volume":"2"},{"id":"schoellerAestheticChillsKnowledgeAcquisition2016","abstract":"This article addresses the relation between aesthetic emotions, knowledge-acquisition, and meaning-making.

To counter this assumption, in this paper we offer a radical embodied (non-representational) account of skilled action that combines ecological psychology and the Deweyan theory of habits. According to our proposal, skilful performance can be understood as composed of sequences of mutually coherent, task-specific perceptual-motor habits. Such habits play a crucial role in simplifying both our exploration of the perceptual environment and our decision-making. However, we argue that what keeps habits situated, precluding them from becoming rote and automatic, are not mental representations but the agent’s conscious attention to the affordances of the environment. It is because the agent is not acting on autopilot but constantly searching for new information for affordances that she can control her behavior, adapting previously learned habits to the current circumstances. We defend that our account provides the resources needed to understand how skilled action can be intelligent (flexible, adaptive, context-sensitive) without having any representational cognitive processes built into them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Segundo-Ortin","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Heras-Escribano","given":"Manuel"}],"citation-key":"segundo-ortinNeitherMindfulMindless2021","container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-021-03238-w","ISSN":"0039-7857, 1573-0964","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"10109-10133","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neither mindful nor mindless, but minded: habits, ecological psychology, and skilled performance","title-short":"Neither mindful nor mindless, but minded","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11229-021-03238-w","volume":"199"},{"id":"sepulveda-pedroLevelsNormDevelopmentPhenomenological2020","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Sepúlveda-Pedro","given":"Miguel A."}],"citation-key":"sepulveda-pedroLevelsNormDevelopmentPhenomenological2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

The standard description of sense-making entails the co-emergence of an agent’s self and a meaningful world, as well as the emergence of a normativity that guides the behaviour of the coupled agent-environment system. This emergent process happens at different levels of interactions: biological, sensorimotor, intercorporeal and linguistic. Sense-making therefore accounts for the natural origins of intentionality and meaning and gives continuity to the emergent enactive processes of life and mind. The standard description of sense-making is nonetheless too abstract and neglects many historical and ecological aspects relevant to the scientiﬁc study of life and mind processes as they happen in concrete ﬁelds of action. To address this issue, I propose the enlarged description of sense-making in the wild, which is based on three fundamental concepts: norm development, enactivesituated normativity and transverse emergence. Norm development deﬁnes sense-making as a historically situated process that transforms the previously given dynamical conﬁguration of the agent-environment system into a new one. Enactivesituated normativity asserts that in addition to the agent’s self-maintenance and the material constraints of the agentenvironment system, many dynamical constraints, ecologically situated, shape the origin, maintenance and development of sense-making processes. Finally, transverse emergence describes the transformational process of the whole agentenvironment system dynamically, as a reconﬁguration of the landscape of attractors that exhibit the typical behaviour of the system. Sense-making in the wild thus aims to facilitate conceptual tools to study enactive cognition, as it happens in concrete ﬁelds of action.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Sepúlveda-Pedro","given":"Miguel A"}],"citation-key":"sepulveda-pedroSenseMakingWildHistorical2023","container-title":"Adaptive Behavior","container-title-short":"Adaptive Behavior","DOI":"10.1177/10597123231190153","ISSN":"1059-7123, 1741-2633","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,17]]},"language":"en","page":"10597123231190153","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sense-Making in the Wild: The Historical and Ecological Depth of Enactive Processes of Life and Cognition","title-short":"Sense-Making in the Wild","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10597123231190153"},{"id":"sharifiComplexityEyeFixation2017","abstract":"There is growing evidence that cognitive processes may have fractal structures as a signature of complexity.

Computer simulations show that from dynamic interactions among the units in such a network, a set of stable attractor states and functionally equivalent groups of situations emerge, such that IF exposed to situation group X, THEN the system settles in attractor Y. This conceptualization explicitly models the effect of situations on a given individual, and therefore can also be used to model the function of interpersonal systems. We demonstrate this possibility by modeling dyadic systems in which one partner's behavior becomes the situational input into the other partner's personality system, and vice versa. The results indicate that each member of the dyad will, in general, exhibit new attractor states. This suggests that the thoughts, affects, and behaviors that an individual typically experiences are a function not of that individual's personality system alone, but rather a function of the interpersonal system of which the individual is a part. Just as individuals have distinctive and stable IF-THEN signatures, so do interpersonal relationships. Understanding the structure of the cognitive-affective processing system of each relationship partner also should enable predictions of their distincitve relational signatures as emergent properties of the interpersonal system that develops.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Shoda","given":"Yuichi"},{"family":"LeeTiernan","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Mischel","given":"Walter"}],"citation-key":"shodaPersonalityDynamicalSystem2002","container-title":"Personality and Social Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Pers Soc Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1207/S15327957PSPR0604_06","ISSN":"1088-8683, 1532-7957","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",11]]},"language":"en","page":"316-325","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Personality as a Dynamical System: Emergence of Stability and Distinctiveness from Intra and Interpersonal Interactions","title-short":"Personality as a Dynamical System","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1207/S15327957PSPR0604_06","volume":"6"},{"id":"shojaieIntermittentFastingCould2017","abstract":"Undesirable and desirable effects of stressors on the body are assigned to distress and eustress, respectively.

Distress and control normally received food and water, whereas IF and IF with distress groups were daily deprived of food and water for two hours. In the second week, the electrical foot shock was induced to distress and IF with distress groups. Finally, the cognitive functions of all mice were evaluated by Barnes maze, their blood samples were taken to determine the plasma level of CORT, IL-6 and TNF-a, and the removed brain and adrenal glands were weighed in the third week. A signiﬁcant gain in plasma level of CORT, IL-6 and TNF-a with a considerable brain hypotrophy and adrenal hypertrophy was found in distress group, whereas IF caused a remarkable reduction of the plasma inﬂammatory factors, especially in IF with distress mice (P 0.05).

Historically, the leading tradition has been Daniel Berlyne's psychobiological model, embodied by the “new experimental aesthetics” movement of the 1970s. That theory explained hedonic qualities of art by referring to arousal-modifying “collative properties” of art, such as complexity, novelty, uncertainty, and conflict. Berlyne's influence on the experimental study of aesthetics has been enormous, largely for the better but also for the worse. Berlyne's suspicion of cognitive psychology led to an unproductive perseveration on arousal as the mechanism of “aesthetic responses.” This article describes how appraisal theories of emotion inform the study of aesthetics. Appraisal theories make new predictions about emotional responses to art, expand the domain of aesthetic emotions beyond positive emotions such as interest and enjoyment, inform other theories (e.g., prototypicality models), and reinterpret past findings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Silvia","given":"Paul J."}],"citation-key":"silviaEmotionalResponsesArt2005","container-title":"Review of General Psychology","container-title-short":"Review of General Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/1089-2680.9.4.342","ISSN":"1089-2680, 1939-1552","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",12]]},"language":"en","page":"342-357","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Emotional Responses to Art: From Collation and Arousal to Cognition and Emotion","title-short":"Emotional Responses to Art","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/1089-2680.9.4.342","volume":"9"},{"id":"silviaFindingMoviesInteresting2011","abstract":"Film and television are major parts of everyday aesthetic experience, but not much is known about viewers’ aesthetic experience of motion picture media.

We suggest that openness to experience, although not normally seen as an emotional trait, is a propensity for awe-like experiences that stretch one’s normal ways of thinking about oneself and the world. A sample of 103 adults took part in a two-phase study that examined the role of openness to experience in two domains: nature and music. In the first phase, people viewed 14 images of the sky and space and rated their experience of each on items related to awe, wonder, and fascination. In the second phase, people listened to a song with qualities known to evoke awe (“Hoppípolla” by Sigur Rós) and rated their experience of it afterward. Openness to experience predicted the experience of awe for both space images (r = .48) and music (r = .35), and the experience of awe was correlated across the domains (r = .35). The other four factors of personality had much smaller effects, and extraversion’s effects were consistently near zero, indicating that awe-like experience differs from the activated positive affectivity typical of extraversion.

Discussion focuses on the importance of reading speed and the failure to enhance validity of a brief rate measure in more skilled readers by incorporating a direct measure of comprehension. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","author":[{"family":"Skinner","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Jacqueline"},{"family":"Morrow","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Hale","given":"Andre"},{"family":"Neddenriep","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Hawkins","given":"Renee"}],"citation-key":"skinnerValidityReadingComprehension2009a","container-title":"Psychology in the Schools","container-title-short":"Psychology in the Schools","DOI":"10.1002/pits.20442","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12,1]]},"page":"1036-1047","source":"ResearchGate","title":"The validity of reading comprehension rate: Reading speed, comprehension, and comprehension rates","title-short":"The validity of reading comprehension rate","type":"article-journal","volume":"46"},{"id":"slaterPresence20058th2005","citation-key":"slaterPresence20058th2005","editor":[{"family":"Slater","given":"Mel"},{"family":"International Society for Presence Research","given":""},{"family":"University College London","given":""}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-0-9551232-0-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"371","publisher":"Univ.

Theoretical frameworks as well as deﬁnitions of habitual behaviors emerging from classic behavioral research have been enriched by new approaches taking account of the identiﬁcation of brain regions and circuits related to habitual behavior. Together, this combination of experimental and theoretical work has provided key insights into how brain circuits underlying actionlearning and action-selection are organized, and how a balance between behavioral ﬂexibility and ﬁxity is achieved. New methods to monitor and manipulate neural activity in real time are allowing us to have a ﬁrst look “under the hood” of a habit as it is formed and expressed. Here we discuss ideas emerging from such approaches. We pay special attention to the unexpected ﬁndings that have arisen from our own experiments suggesting that habitual behaviors likely require the simultaneous activity of multiple distinct components, or operators, seen as responsible for the contrasting dynamics of neural activity in both cortico-limbic and sensorimotor circuits recorded concurrently during different stages of habit learning. The neural dynamics identiﬁed thus far do not fully meet expectations derived from traditional models of the structure of habits, and the behavioral measures of habits that we have made also are not fully aligned with these models. We explore these new clues as opportunities to reﬁne an understanding of habits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Kyle S."},{"family":"Graybiel","given":"Ann M."}],"citation-key":"smithInvestigatingHabitsStrategies2014","container-title":"Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

In addition, a conceptual model of intertwined learning-teaching processes is discussed, and dynamic modeling as an approach to theory formation about teaching-learning processes. The focus lies on the evolution term, the timescale of interaction processes, state space as a perspective on teacher-student interaction dynamics, and the principle of agency.

However, the effects of different types of postures and different underfoot surfaces on PB have not been adequately addressed. Purpose: The main aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of different conditions of footwear, surfaces, and standing positions on static and dynamic PB ability of young ballet dancers. Method: Thirty-six male and female young professional ballet dancers (aged 14-19) completed static and dynamic balance testing, measured by head and lumbar accelerometers, while standing on one leg in the turn-out position, under six different conditions: 1. “relaxed” posture; 2. “ballet” posture; 3. barefoot; 4. ballet shoes with textured insoles; 5. barefoot on a textured mat; 6. barefoot on a spiky mat. Results: A condition effect was found for static and dynamic PB. Static PB was reduced when dancers stood in the “ballet” posture compared with standing in the “relaxed” posture, and when standing on a textured mat and on a spiky mat (p<.05); and, Static PB in the “relaxed” posture was significantly better than PB in all the other five conditions tested. Dynamic PB was significantly better while standing in ballet shoes with textured insoles and when standing on a spiky mat, compared with all other conditions (p<.05). Conclusions: The practical implications derived from the present study are that both male and female dancers should try to be “relaxed” in their postural muscles when practicing a “ballet” aligned position; including dance practice on different types of floors and on different types of textured/spiky materials may result in skill transfer to practice on normal floor surfaces; and, both static and dynamic PB exercises should be assessed and generalized into practical dance routines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Steinberg","given":"Nili"},{"family":"Waddington","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Adams","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Karin","given":"Janet"},{"family":"Tirosh","given":"Oren"}],"citation-key":"steinbergShouldBalletDancers2018","container-title":"Motor Control","container-title-short":"Motor Control","DOI":"10.1123/mc.2016-0076","ISSN":"1087-1640, 1543-2696","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1]]},"language":"en","page":"45-66","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Should Ballet Dancers Vary Postures and Underfoot Surfaces When Practicing Postural Balance?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/10.1123/mc.2016-0076","volume":"22"},{"id":"stennerLabStreamingLayer2023","abstract":"What's Changed\n\n\nFix recovery issues by @tstenner in https://github.com/sccn/liblsl/pull/195\n\nFix lsl_cpp.h exception handling by @jchen-dawnscene in https://github.com/sccn/liblsl/pull/194\n\nUse native endianness for \"portable\" byte order by @tstenner in https://github.com/sccn/liblsl/pull/196\n\nAdd concurrency cancellation to GHA workflows. by @cboulay in https://github.com/sccn/liblsl/pull/197\n\nNew Contributors\n\n\n\n@jchen-dawnscene made their first contribution in https://github.com/sccn/liblsl/pull/194\n\n\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/sccn/liblsl/compare/v1.16.1...v1.16.2","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Stenner","given":"Tristan"},{"family":"Boulay","given":"Chadwick"},{"family":"Grivich","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Medine","given":"David"},{"family":"Kothe","given":"Christian"},{"family":"tobiasherzke","given":""},{"family":"chausner","given":""},{"family":"Grimm","given":"Giso"},{"family":"xloem","given":""},{"family":"Biancarelli","given":"Arthur"},{"family":"Mansencal","given":"Boris"},{"family":"Maanen","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Frey","given":"Jérémy"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jidong"},{"family":"kyucrane","given":""},{"family":"Powell","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Clisson","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"phfix","given":""}],"citation-key":"stennerLabStreamingLayer2023","DOI":"10.5281/zenodo.7978343","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,28]]},"publisher":"Zenodo","source":"Zenodo","title":"Lab Streaming Layer","title-short":"sccn/liblsl","type":"software","URL":"https://zenodo.org/records/7978343","version":"v1.16.2"},{"id":"stephenDynamicsInsightMathematical2009","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Stephen","given":"Damian G."},{"family":"Boncoddo","given":"Rebecca A."},{"family":"Magnuson","given":"James S."},{"family":"Dixon","given":"James A."}],"citation-key":"stephenDynamicsInsightMathematical2009","container-title":"Memory & Cognition","container-title-short":"Memory & Cognition","DOI":"10.3758/MC.37.8.1132","ISSN":"0090-502X, 1532-5946","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12]]},"language":"en","license":"http://www.springer.com/tdm","page":"1132-1149","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The dynamics of insight: Mathematical discovery as a phase transition","title-short":"The dynamics of insight","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.3758/MC.37.8.1132","volume":"37"},{"id":"stephenDynamicsInsightMathematical2009a","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Stephen","given":"Damian G."},{"family":"Boncoddo","given":"Rebecca A."},{"family":"Magnuson","given":"James S."},{"family":"Dixon","given":"James A."}],"citation-key":"stephenDynamicsInsightMathematical2009a","container-title":"Memory & Cognition","container-title-short":"Memory & Cognition","DOI":"10.3758/MC.37.8.1132","ISSN":"0090-502X, 1532-5946","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1132-1149","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The dynamics of insight: Mathematical discovery as a phase transition","title-short":"The dynamics of insight","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.3758/MC.37.8.1132","volume":"37"},{"id":"stephenDynamicsRepresentationalChange2009","abstract":"Explaining how the cognitive system can create new structures has been a major challenge for cognitive science. Self-organization from the theory of nonlinear dynamics offers an account of this remarkable phenomenon. Two studies provide an initial test of the hypothesis that the emergence of new cognitive structure follows the same universal principles as emergence in other domains (e.g., fluids, lasers). In both studies, participants initially solved gear-system problems by manually tracing the force across a system of gears. Subsequently, they discovered that the gears form an alternating sequence, thereby demonstrating a new cognitive structure. In both studies, dynamical analyses of action during problem solving predicted the spontaneous emergence of the new cognitive structure. Study 1 showed that a peak in entropy, followed by negentropy, key indicators of self-organization, predicted discovery of alternation. Study 2 replicated these effects, and showed that increasing environmental entropy accelerated discovery, a classic prediction from dynamics. Additional analyses based on the relationship between phase transitions and power-law behavior provide converging evidence. The studies provide an initial demonstration of the emergence of cognitive structure through self-organization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Stephen","given":"Damian G."},{"family":"Dixon","given":"James A."},{"family":"Isenhower","given":"Robert W."}],"citation-key":"stephenDynamicsRepresentationalChange2009","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance","DOI":"10.1037/a0014510","ISSN":"1939-1277, 0096-1523","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","page":"1811-1832","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dynamics of representational change: Entropy, action, and cognition.","title-short":"Dynamics of representational change","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0014510","volume":"35"},{"id":"stephenRoleFractalityPerceptual2010","abstract":"Perceptual systems must learn to explore and to use the resulting information to hone performance.

However, this apparent homogeneity can be misleading, especially as it spans more scales. Reducing biological processes to one powerlaw relationship neglects rich cascade dynamics.

However, variability is much more than the undesired signature of discoordination: structure in both its distributional properties and temporal sequence can reveal control priorities. Extending from the notion that signal-dependent noise corrupts information transmission in the neuromotor system, this review tracks more recent recognitions that the complex dynamic motor system in its interaction with task constraints creates high-dimensional spaces with multiple equivalent solutions. Further analysis differentiates these solutions to have different degrees of noise-sensitivity, goalrelevance or additional costs. Practice proceeds from exploration of these solution spaces to then exploitation with further channeling of noise. Extended practice leads to fine-tuning of skill brought about by reducing noise. These distinct changes in variability are suggested as a way to characterize stages of learning. Capitalizing on the sensitivity of the CNS to noise, interventions can add extrinsic or amplify intrinsic noise to guide (re-)learning desired behaviors. The persistence and generalization of acquired skill is still largely understudied, although an essential element of skill. Consistent with advances in the physical sciences, there is increasing realization that noise can have beneficial effects. Analysis of the non-random structure of variability may reveal more than analysis of only its mean.","author":[{"family":"Sternad","given":"Dagmar"}],"citation-key":"sternadDepartmentBiologyElectrical","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Department of Biology, Electrical and Computer Engineering and Physics,","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"sternatLowHedonicTone2018","abstract":"Background: The burdens imposed by treatment-resistant depression (TRD) necessitate the identification of predictive factors that may improve patient treatment and outcomes. Because depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are frequently comorbid and share a complex relationship, we hypothesized that ADHD may be a predictive factor for the diagnosis of TRD. This exploratory study aimed to determine the percentage of undetected ADHD in those with TRD and evaluate factors associated with treatment resistance and undetected ADHD in depressed patients. Subjects and methods: Adults referred (n=160) for psychiatric consultation completed a structured interview (MINI Plus, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus) to assess the presence of psychiatric disorders.\nResults: TRD was significantly associated with the number of diagnoses (P,0.001), past (P,0.001) and present medications (P,0.001), chronic anhedonia (P=0.013), and suicide ideation (P=0.008). Undetected ADHD was present in 34% of TRD patients. The number of referral diagnoses (P,0.001), failed medications (P=0.002), and past selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor failures (P=0.035) were predictive of undetected ADHD in TRD.\nConclusion: Undetected ADHD may be more prevalent among TRD patients than previously thought. In addition, TRD patients are more likely to present with psychiatric comorbidity than non-TRD patients.

Individuals completed ten plate-loaded exercises to determine their maximum dynamic strengths (1RM) and peak power outputs (PP). Power was tested at 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80% 1RM using a linear position transducer. PP was expressed relative to the highest power produced (PPREL).\nResults: Multi-joint exercises produced optimal load values at 50–60%1RM for leg press, 50%1RM for chest press, and 40–60%1RM for seated row, with no signiﬁcant diﬀerences among loads for shoulder press. Singlejoint exercise optimal loads were seen at 50–60% for hip adduction, 50–70%1RM for calf raise, 60–80%1RM for biceps curl, and 50–80%1RM for triceps extension, with no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between loads for hip abduction or leg curl. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found between sexes for any exercise.\nConclusions: Diﬀerent optimal load ranges are required for individual plate-loaded exercises in older persons.

The demonstrability of synchrony depends on the amount of data used in the analysis. We investigated how demonstrability of physiological synchrony varies with varying group size and stimulus duration. Thirty participants watched six 10 min movie clips while their HR and EDA were monitored using wearable sensors (Movisens EdaMove 4 and Wahoo Tickr, respectively). We calculated inter-subject correlations as a measure of synchrony. Group size and stimulus duration were varied by using data from subsets of the participants and movie clips in the analysis. We found that for HR, higher synchrony correlated signiﬁcantly with the number of answers correct for questions about the movie, conﬁrming that physiological synchrony is associated with attention. For both HR and EDA, with increasing amounts of data used, the percentage of participants with signiﬁcant synchrony increased. Importantly, we found that it did not matter how the amount of data was increased. Increasing the group size or increasing the stimulus duration led to the same results. Initial comparisons with results from other studies suggest that our results do not only apply to our speciﬁc set of stimuli and participants.

At first glance, non-insight appears to depend on the availability and taxation of cognitive resources to execute the step-by-step approach, whereas insight does not, or to a lesser extent. However, this remains debated. To investigate the reliance of both solution types on cognitive resources, we assessed the involvement of the prefrontal cortex using vagally mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV) as an index. Participants (N = 68) solved 70 compound remote associates word puzzles solvable with insight and non-insight. Before, during, and after solving the word puzzles, we measured the vmHRV. Our results showed that resting-state vmHRV (trait) showed a negative association with behavioural performance for both solution types. This might reflect inter-individual differences in inhibitory control. As the solution search requires one to think of remote associations, inhibitory control might hamper rather than aid this process. Furthermore, we observed, for both solution types, a vmHRV increase from resting-state to solution search (state), lingering on in the post-task recovery period. This could mark the increase of prefrontal resources to promote an open-minded stance, essential for divergent thinking, which arguably is crucial for this task. Our findings suggest that, at a general level, both solution types share common aspects. However, a closer analysis of early and late solutions and puzzle difficulty suggested that metacognitive differentiation between insight and non-insight improved with higher trait vmHRV, and that a unique association between trait vmHRV and puzzle difficulty was present for each solution type.","container-title":"Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Insight and non-insight problem solving: A heart rate variability study","author":[{"family":"Stuyck","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Demeyer","given":"Febe"},{"family":"Bratanov","given":"Christo"},{"family":"Cleeremans","given":"Axel"}],"citation-key":"stuyckInsightNoninsightProblem","library":"My Library","citekey":"stuyckInsightNoninsightProblem"},{"id":"suckfullFilmsThatMove2010","abstract":"This article investigates the effects of films on an audience, using an interdisciplinary empirical approach connecting film analysis and psychophysiological measurement.

However, little work has been done to develop a theoretical model that oﬀers a parsimonious rationale explaining why certain leadership attributes are considered “charismatic” while others are not, or how these attributes combine to produce charismatic eﬀects. Addressing these issues, we present a model that situates emotion as the primary variable in the charismatic process. We use recent research on the moral emotions to frame a theory of followership-relevant emotions (FREs) that describes how leaders use emotions such as compassion, admiration, and anger to compel their followers to act. We then discuss the Elicit-Channel (EC) model of charismatic leadership, positing that the charismatic relationship is a ﬁve-step, cyclical process. In the EC model, leaders elicit highly motivating emotions from their followers and then channel those emotions to produce action that, if successful, results in outcomes such as positive aﬀect and trust. These outcomes then enable the leader to continue the cycle, eliciting emotion once more. We conclude by oﬀering a research agenda, addressing potential methodological concerns, and discussing future directions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Sy","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Horton","given":"Calen"},{"family":"Riggio","given":"Ronald"}],"citation-key":"syCharismaticLeadershipEliciting2018","container-title":"The Leadership Quarterly","container-title-short":"The Leadership Quarterly","DOI":"10.1016/j.leaqua.2017.12.008","ISSN":"10489843","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2]]},"language":"en","page":"58-69","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Charismatic leadership: Eliciting and channeling follower emotions","title-short":"Charismatic leadership","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1048984317300693","volume":"29"},{"id":"tadicSelfOrganisedCriticalDynamics2021","abstract":"Studies of many complex systems have revealed new collective behaviours that emerge through the mechanisms of self-organised critical ﬂuctuations.

The self-similarity of critical ﬂuctuations enables us to describe the system using fewer parameters and universal functions that, on the other hand, can simplify the computational and information complexity. Currently, the cutting-edge research on self-organised critical systems across the scales strives to formulate a unifying mathematical framework, utilise the critical universal properties in information theory, and decipher the role of hidden geometry. As a prominent example, we study the ﬁeld-driven spin dynamics on the hysteresis loop in a network with higher-order structures described by simplicial complexes, which provides a geometric-frustration environment. While providing motivational illustrations from physical, biological, and social systems, along with their networks, we also demonstrate how the self-organised criticality occurs at the interplay of the complex topology and driving mode.

We explore the effect of visualization using physiological cues that allow users to interpret emotional behaviors of remote parties with whom they are interacting in real time. The proposed visual representation allows users to infer emotional patterns from physiological cues that can potentially inﬂuence their communication approach toward a more aggressive style or maintain passive and peaceful interaction. We conducted a study involving participants who were paired up for a collaborative assessment task, interacting via voice only, videoconference, or a visual representation of the physiological measurements. Participants perceived the usage of our visual representation with higher group cohesiveness than using voice-only interaction. Further analysis shows that the visual representation significantly increases the positive affect score (i.e., participants are perceived to be more alert and demonstrate less distress) during remote collaboration. We discuss the possibilities of the proposed visual representation to support empathic communication during remote collaboration, and the beneﬁts to the remote partners of having positive affect and group cohesiveness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Tan","given":"Chiew Seng Sean"},{"family":"Luyten","given":"Kris"},{"family":"Van Den Bergh","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Schöning","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Coninx","given":"Karin"}],"citation-key":"tanRolePhysiologicalCues2014","container-title":"Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments","container-title-short":"Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments","DOI":"10.1162/PRES_a_00168","ISSN":"1054-7460","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"90-107","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Role of Physiological Cues during Remote Collaboration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://direct.mit.edu/pvar/article/23/1/90-107/18872","volume":"23"},{"id":"thelanguageacademyuniversititeknologimalaysiamalaysiaMetacognitiveReadingStrategies2017","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to investigate the metacognitive reading strategies employed by fifty four undergraduates in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM).

As a consequence, motor modules may be useful in assessing sensorimotor deficits specific to an individual, and define targets for the rational development of novel rehabilitation therapies that enhance neural plasticity and sculpt motor recovery. We propose that motor module organization is disrupted and may be improved by therapy in spinal cord injury, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease.

We present a theoretical model of cortical coordination dynamics that shows how brain areas may cooperate (integration) and at the same time retain their functional speciﬁcity (segregation). This model expresses a range of desirable properties that the brain is known to exhibit, including selforganization, multi-functionality, metastability and switching. Empirically, the model motivates a thorough investigation of collective phase relationships among brain oscillations in neurophysiological data. The most serious obstacle to interpreting coupled oscillations as genuine evidence of inter-areal coordination in the brain stems from volume conduction of electrical ﬁelds. Spurious coupling due to volume conduction gives rise to zero-lag (inphase) and antiphase synchronization whose magnitude and persistence obscure the subtle expression of real synchrony. Through forward modeling and the help of a novel colorimetric method, we show how true synchronization can be deciphered from continuous EEG patterns. Developing empirical efforts along the lines of continuous EEG analysis constitutes a major response to the challenge of understanding how different brain areas work together. Key predictions of cortical coordination dynamics can now be tested thereby revealing the essential modus operandi of the intact living brain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Tognoli","given":"Emmanuelle"},{"family":"Kelso","given":"J.A.

According to Coordination Dynamics, such laws specify the ﬂow of coordination states produced by functional synergies of elements (e.g., cells, body parts, brain areas, people. . .) that are temporarily organized as single, coherent units. These coordinative structures or synergies may be mathematically characterized as informationally coupled self-organizing dynamical systems (Coordination Dynamics). In this paper, we start from a simple foundation, an elemental model system for social interactions, whose behavior has been captured in the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model. We follow a tried and tested scientiﬁc method that tightly interweaves experimental neurobehavioral studies and mathematical models. We use this method to further develop a body of empirical research that advances the theory toward more generalized forms. In concordance with this interdisciplinary spirit, the present paper is written both as an overview of relevant advances and as an introduction to its mathematical underpinnings. We demonstrate HKB’s evolution in the context of social coordination along several directions, with its applicability growing to increasingly complex scenarios. In particular, we show that accommodating for symmetry breaking in intrinsic dynamics and coupling, multiscale generalization and adaptation are principal evolutions. We conclude that a general framework for social coordination dynamics is on the horizon, in which models support experiments with hypothesis generation and mechanistic insights.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Tognoli","given":"Emmanuelle"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Mengsen"},{"family":"Fuchs","given":"Armin"},{"family":"Beetle","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Kelso","given":"J.

Despite this fact and the inherent nested structure of groups, little research has assessed physiological synchronization between group members from a multi-level perspective, thus limiting a full understanding of the dynamics between members. To address this gap of knowledge we re-analyzed a large dataset (N = 261) comprising physiological and psychological data that were collected in two laboratory studies that involved two different social group tasks. In both studies, following the group task, members reported their experience of group cohesion via questionnaires. We utilized a nonlinear analysis method-multidimensional recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis that allowed us to represent physiological synchronization in cardiological interbeat intervals between group members at the individual-level and at the group-level. We found that across studies and their conditions, the change in physiological synchrony from baseline to group interaction predicted a psychological sense of group cohesion. This result was evident both at the individual and the group levels and was not modiﬁed by the context of the interaction. The individual- and group-level effects were highly correlated. These results indicate that the relationship between synchrony and cohesion is a multilayered construct. We re-afﬁrm the role of physiological synchrony for cohesion in groups. Future studies are needed to crystallize our understanding of the differences and similarities between synchrony at the individual-level and synchrony at the group level to illuminate under which conditions one of these levels has primacy, or how they interact.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Tomashin","given":"Alon"},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Ilanit"},{"family":"Wallot","given":"Sebastian"}],"citation-key":"tomashinInterpersonalPhysiologicalSynchrony2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

Our focus in this article is on two aspects of individual variation: global processing speed (e.g., Salthouse, 1996) and working-memory capacity (e.g., Just & Carpenter, 1992). Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2001), we tested the extent to which overall reading speed and working-memory capacity moderate the degree to which syntactic and semantic information affect fixation times. Previous published data (Traxler et al., 2005) showed that working memory capacity and syntactic complexity interacted to determine fixation times in an eye-movement monitoring experiment. In a new set of models based on this same data set, we found that working-memory capacity interacted with sentence-characteristic variables only when processing speed was not included in the model.

In addition, we illustrate how a novel multimodal approach including mobile brain and body imaging (MoBi) combined with phenomenological methods, and the implementation of interactive paradigms in a natural context, are adequate procedures to study empathy from the 5E approach.

Nonverbal synchrony was quantiﬁed by the coordination of interactants’ body movement, using an automated video-analysis algorithm (motion energy analysis). Traits were assessed with standard questionnaires of personality, attachment, interactional style, psychopathology, and interpersonal reactivity. We included 168 previously unacquainted individuals who were randomly allocated to same-sex dyads (84 females, 84 males, mean age 27.8 years). Dyads discussed four topics of general interest drawn from an urn of eight topics, and ﬁnally engaged in a fun interaction. Each interaction lasted 5 min. In between interactions, participants repeatedly assessed their affect. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we found moderate to strong effect sizes for synchrony to occur, especially in competitive and fun task conditions. Positive affect was associated positively with synchrony, negative affect was associated negatively. As for causal direction, data supported the interpretation that synchrony entailed affect rather than vice versa. The link between nonverbal synchrony and affect was strongest in female dyads.

We wished to connect this descriptor to personality attributes.\nMethod: We deﬁne the social present by the duration of signiﬁcant nonverbal synchrony, based on the phenomenon of movement synchrony that generally emerges in social interactions. It is thus an implicit and objective measure that can be implemented by automated video analyses. In this study, 168 healthy participants were invited to verbal conversations in same-sex dyads. We analyzed the associations of the social present with personality attributes and interaction types (competition, cooperation, fun task).\nResults: The average duration of the social present was 6.0 seconds, highest in competitive interactions and in male-male dyads. People with higher Openness to Experience, higher avoidant attachment, and lower narcissistic interpersonal styles showed extended social present in their interactions.\nConclusions: The concept of the social present extends personality attributes to the interpersonal domain and to intersubjectivity. The social present may be computed based on movement synchrony but also prosodic or physiological synchronies.

Transitions detected by our methods predict narrative events, are similar across task and rest, and are correlated with activation of regions associated with spontaneous thought. Based on the centrality of semantics to thought, we argue these transitions serve as general, implicit neurobiological markers of new thoughts, and that their frequency, which is stable across contexts, approximates participants’ mentation rate. By enabling observation of idiosyncratic transitions, our approach supports many applications, including phenomenological access to the black box of resting cognition. To illustrate the utility of this access, we regress resting fMRI transition rate and movie-viewing transition conformity against trait neuroticism, thereby providing a first neural confirmation of mental noise theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Tseng","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Poppenk","given":"Jordan"}],"citation-key":"tsengBrainMetastateTransitions2020","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-020-17255-9","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,13]]},"language":"en","page":"3480","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Brain meta-state transitions demarcate thoughts across task contexts exposing the mental noise of trait neuroticism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17255-9","volume":"11"},{"id":"tuckerNeurodevelopmentalProcessSelfOrganization2016","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Tucker","given":"Don M."},{"family":"Luu","given":"Phan"},{"family":"Poulsen","given":"Catherine"}],"citation-key":"tuckerNeurodevelopmentalProcessSelfOrganization2016","container-title":"Developmental Psychopathology","DOI":"10.1002/9781119125556.devpsy217","editor":[{"family":"Cicchetti","given":"Dante"}],"event-place":"Hoboken, NJ, USA","ISBN":"978-1-119-12555-6 978-1-118-12179-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,10]]},"language":"en","page":"1-30","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","publisher-place":"Hoboken, NJ, USA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Neurodevelopmental Process of Self-Organization","type":"chapter","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119125556.devpsy217"},{"id":"tuitertDoesPracticingWide2017","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Tuitert","given":"Inge"},{"family":"Bootsma","given":"Reinoud J."},{"family":"Schoemaker","given":"Marina M."},{"family":"Otten","given":"Egbert"},{"family":"Mouton","given":"Leonora J."},{"family":"Bongers","given":"Raoul M."}],"citation-key":"tuitertDoesPracticingWide2017","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0181041","editor":[{"family":"Van Beers","given":"Robert J."}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7,10]]},"language":"en","page":"e0181041","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Does practicing a wide range of joint angle configurations lead to higher flexibility in a manual obstacle-avoidance target-pointing task?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181041","volume":"12"},{"id":"turveyCommentaryDevelopmentPerceptionAction1993","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Turvey","given":"M.

To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modelling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between actors, whereas through EDM we conceptualised coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to RMS amplitude time series, could be used to tell apart coordinating from non-coordinating musicians. Our results also suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, i.e. as more actors in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.","author":[{"family":"Vaarten","given":"Lennard"}],"citation-key":"vaartenCapturingCoordinationMusical","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Capturing Coordination In Musical Joint Improvisation A Complex Systems Approach","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"vallacherChaosSocialPsychology","author":[{"family":"Vallacher","given":"Robin R."},{"family":"Nowak","given":"Andrzej"}],"citation-key":"vallacherChaosSocialPsychology","title":"The Chaos in Social Psychology","type":"chapter"},{"id":"vallacherEmergenceDynamicalSocial1997","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Vallacher","given":"Robin R."},{"family":"Nowak","given":"Andrzej"}],"citation-key":"vallacherEmergenceDynamicalSocial1997","container-title":"Psychological Inquiry","container-title-short":"Psychological Inquiry","DOI":"10.1207/s15327965pli0802_1","ISSN":"1047-840X, 1532-7965","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",4]]},"language":"en","page":"73-99","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Emergence of Dynamical Social Psychology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327965pli0802_1","volume":"8"},{"id":"vallacherThinkingBoxdynamicalConstraints2009","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Vallacher","given":"Robin R."},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Deanna"}],"citation-key":"vallacherThinkingBoxdynamicalConstraints2009","container-title":"European Journal of Social Psychology","container-title-short":"Eur.

Some argue that music should be understood as a naturally selected adaptation, while others claim that music is a product of culture with little or no relevance for the survival of the species. We review these arguments, suggesting that while interesting and well-reasoned positions have been offered on both sides of the debate, the nature-or-culture (or adaptation vs. non-adaptation) assumptions that have traditionally driven the discussion have resulted in a problematic either/or dichotomy. We then consider an alternative “biocultural” proposal that appears to offer a way forward. As we discuss, this approach draws on a range of research in theoretical biology, archeology, neuroscience, embodied and ecological cognition, and dynamical systems theory (DST), positing a more integrated model that sees biological and cultural dimensions as aspects of the same evolving system. Following this, we outline the enactive approach to cognition, discussing the ways it aligns with the biocultural perspective. Put simply, the enactive approach posits a deep continuity between mind and life, where cognitive processes are explored in terms of how self-organizing living systems enact relationships with the environment that are relevant to their survival and well-being. It highlights the embodied and ecologically situated nature of living agents, as well as the active role they play in their own developmental processes. Importantly, the enactive approach sees cognitive and evolutionary processes as driven by a range of interacting factors, including the socio-cultural forms of activity that characterize the lives of more complex creatures such as ourselves. We offer some suggestions for how this approach might enhance and extend the biocultural model.

While this research has produced many important insights, it has also traditionally tended to explore creativity in terms of the reception of products or outcomes, conceiving of it as a cognitive process that is limited to the individual domain of the creative agent. More recently, however, researchers have begun to develop perspectives on creativity that highlight the patterns of adaptive embodied interaction that occur between multiple agents, as well as the broader sociomaterial milieu they are situated in. This has promoted new understandings of creativity, which is now often considered as a distributed phenomenon. Because music involves such a wide range of socio-cultural, bodily, technological, and temporal dimensions it is increasingly taken as a paradigmatic example for researchers who wish to explore creativity from this more relational perspective. In this article, we aim to contribute to this project by discussing musical creativity in light of recent developments in embodied cognitive science. More specifically, we will attempt to frame an approach to musical creativity based in an 4E (embodied, embedded, enactive, and extended) understanding of cognition. We suggest that this approach may help us better understand creativity in terms of how interacting individuals and social groups bring forth worlds of meaning through shared, embodied processes of dynamic interactivity. We also explore how dynamical systems theory (DST) may offer useful tools for research and theory that align closely with the 4E perspective.

Nonetheless, the different ﬁelds of ecological psychology studying these phenomena do not seem to make this situated nature an object of study. To integrate both ﬁelds and extend the reach of the ecological approach, we introduce the Skilled Intentionality Framework that situates both social coordination and affordance perception within the human form of life and its rich landscape of affordances. We argue that in the human form of life the social and the material are intertwined and best understood as sociomateriality. Taking the form of life as our starting point foregrounds sociomateriality in each perspective we take on engaging with affordances. Using ethnographical examples we show how sociomateriality shows up from three different perspectives we take on affordances in a real-life situation. One perspective shows us a landscape of affordances that the sociomaterial environment offers. Zooming in on this landscape to the perspective of a local observer, we can focus on an individual coordinating with affordances offered by things and other people situated in this landscape. Finally, viewed from within this unfolding activity, we arrive at the person’s lived perspective: a ﬁeld of relevant affordances solicits activity. The Skilled Intentionality Framework offers a way of integrating social coordination and affordance theory by drawing attention to these complementary perspectives. We end by showing a reallife example from the practice of architecture that suggests how this situated view that foregrounds sociomateriality can extend the scope of ecological psychology to forms of so-called “higher” cognition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Dijk","given":"Ludger"},{"family":"Rietveld","given":"Erik"}],"citation-key":"vandijkForegroundingSociomaterialPractice2017","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

Starting from architects that anticipate the possibility to make an architectural installation over the course of many months, in this paper we develop a process-based account of affordances that includes long-term anticipation within its scope. We present a framework in which situations and their affordances unfold, and can be thought of as continuing a history of practices into a current situational activity. In this activity affordances invite skilled participants to act further. Via these invitations one situation develops into the other; an unfolding process that sets up the conditions for its own continuation. Central to our process account of affordances is the idea that engaged individuals can be responsive to the direction of the process to which their actions contribute. Anticipation, at any temporal scale, is then part and parcel of keeping attuned to the movement of the unfolding situations to which an individual contributes. We concretize our account by returning to the example of anticipation observed in architectural practice. This account of anticipation opens the door to considering a wide array of human activities traditionally characterized as ‘higher’ cognition in terms of engaging with affordances.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Dijk","given":"Ludger"},{"family":"Rietveld","given":"Erik"}],"citation-key":"vandijkSituatedAnticipation2021","container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-018-02013-8","ISSN":"0039-7857, 1573-0964","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","page":"349-371","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Situated anticipation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11229-018-02013-8","volume":"198"},{"id":"vandijkTemporalizingAgencyMoving2016","abstract":"In this article we reconsider the relation between time and agency that is at the heart of the current distinction between online and offline cognition. Mainstream psychology starts out with an abstract notion of time, in which only the current moment is real. Therefore persisting representations are necessary for agents to make their way across time. We take Gibson and Heidegger to offer a different account of the relation between time and agency. Their theories suggest that, by taking agents in their world as coordinated motion, the need for representations disappears. We extend this picture of human involvement by showing how this can account for the concept of time by retaining its relational, situated structure. Finally, we return to the distinction between onand offline cognition and show that offline cognition need not be considered a different type of cognition, but only a different mode of coordinating: offline cognition in such a view is not a return to the internal manipulation of content; rather, it is a contentless, unstable mode of coordinating to the world in which the relational constitution of agency falters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Dijk","given":"Ludger"},{"family":"Withagen","given":"Rob"}],"citation-key":"vandijkTemporalizingAgencyMoving2016","container-title":"Theory & Psychology","container-title-short":"Theory & Psychology","DOI":"10.1177/0959354315596080","ISSN":"0959-3543, 1461-7447","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2]]},"language":"en","page":"5-26","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Temporalizing agency: Moving beyond on- and offline cognition","title-short":"Temporalizing agency","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0959354315596080","volume":"26"},{"id":"vangeertOrderComplexityAesthetic2020","abstract":"Which stimulus and person characteristics determine aesthetic appreciation?

The aim of the present paper is to validate an agent-based model of emotion contagion at the level of group emotion, by comparing simulations against the emotional development of real people in small groups. To study the effect of emotion contagion, the participants interacted via a video call, where they were virtually placed in different social environments while they played a quiz. This allowed the exchange of emotion among all, some or none of the participants. The patterns of emotional development in the empirical results supported our hypotheses based on literature of emotion contagion and social norms. Further, the simulations with the complete model resembled many of these patterns. When emotion contagion was disabled in the model, the resemblance decreased. These results give a ﬁrst indication that emotion contagion occurs in groups that meet via video calls, and can in-part be predicted by the proposed model of emotion contagion. Yet, further study with a larger and more diverse empirical sample is needed, as well as comparisons across contagion mechanisms, to draw stronger conclusions and ultimately justify societal application.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Haeringen","given":"Erik Stefan"},{"family":"Veltmeijer","given":"Emmeke Anna"},{"family":"Gerritsen","given":"Charlotte"}],"citation-key":"vanhaeringenEmpiricalValidationAgentBased2024","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

We studied audience responses to modern dance performances conducted two field experiments and one lab experiment (N = 263, 363 and 147). Performances were developed jointly with choreographers: dancers acted as an aggregate of individuals or displayed mechanical or organic solidarity. As predicted, the emergent bond between audience members and dancers was influenced by the kind of solidarity on display. When dancers displayed mechanical solidarity, the emergence of bonds was mainly predicted by perceived unity. When organic solidarity was displayed, the individual value of each dancer played a key role. Interestingly, overall artistic evaluation was affected in parallel with the development of bonds: the kind of solidarity displayed influenced performance evaluation. Finally, Experiment 2b showed that solidarity displayed on stage influenced the postperformance cooperative behaviour among audience members.

Using multidimensional joint recurrence quantification analysis (MdJRQA), we examined which gaze type was related to the highest infant’s hemodynamic cortical activity, in terms of Recurrence Rate. Regression modeling revealed that maternal social gaze co-occurred more often with the infant’s cortical activity compared to the other gaze types. Moreover, using recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) we found that maternal social gaze also was the gaze behavior that best predicted infant’s word segmentation in terms of Entropy.

Dynamic systems perspectives argue that insight arises from self-organizing perceptual and motor processes. Entropy and fractal scaling are potential markers for emerging new and effective solutions. This study investigated whether specific features associated with self-organization in dynamical systems can distinguish between individuals who succeed and those who fail in solving insight tasks. To achieve this, we analyzed pupillary diameter fluctuations of children aged 6 to 12 during the 8-coin task, a well-established insight task. The participants were divided into two groups: successful (\n              n\n              = 24) and unsuccessful (\n              n\n              = 43) task completion. Entropy, determinism, recurrence ratio, and the β scaling exponent were estimated using Recurrence Quantification and Power Spectrum Density analyses. The results indicated that the solver group exhibited more significant uncertainty and lower predictability in pupillary diameter fluctuations before finding the solution. Recurrence Quantification Analysis revealed changes that went unnoticed by mean and standard deviation measures. However, the β scaling exponent did not differentiate between the two groups. These findings suggest that entropy and determinism in pupillary diameter fluctuations can identify early differences in problem-solving success. Further research is needed to determine the exclusive role of perceptual and motor activity in generating insights and investigate these results’ generalizability to other tasks and populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Vásquez-Pinto","given":"Sebastián"},{"family":"Morales-Bader","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Cox","given":"Ralf F.

In order to obtain a Five-Factor Model (FFM) prototype for the charismatic leader, experts in the ﬁeld of leadership and personality research were invited to participate in an expert panel. For each of the 30 NEO PI-R facets, experts (N = 38) rated the prototypic case of a successful charismatic leader on a scale ranging between 1 (extremely low) and 9 (extremely high). Based on the FFM count technique (Miller, Bagby, Pilkonis, Reynolds, & Lynam, 2005), an easy-to-use count was developed in which facets that were rated as being prototypically high (≥7) or low (≤3) were summed together to calculate the FFM charisma score. To investigate the predictive validity of the FFM charisma count in terms of work-related outcomes, the 1994 Ghent alumni sample was used in which college alumni (N = 262) were administered the NEO PI-R before entering the labor market and 15 years later when their professional careers had unfolded. The results demonstrate that FFM charisma was positively related to extrinsic career outcomes 15 years later, including income, number of subordinates, and managerial level. Moreover, FFM charisma was positively associated with adaptive performance, and with career roles that directly relate to charismatic leadership.

Moreover, we delved deeper into this curvilinear association by (c) examining moderation by the leader’s level of adjustment and by (d) testing a process model through which the effects of charismatic personality on effectiveness are explained with a consideration of specific leader behaviors. Study 1 validated HDS charisma (Hogan Development Survey) as a useful trait-based measure of charisma. In Study 2 a sample of leaders (N ϭ 306) were assessed in the context of a 360-degree development center. In line with the too-much-of-a-good-thing effect, an inverted U-shaped relationship between charismatic personality and observer-rated leader effectiveness was found, indicating that moderate levels are better than low or high levels of charisma. Study 3 (N ϭ 287) replicated this curvilinear relationship and further illustrated the moderating role of leader adjustment, in such a way that the inflection point after which the effects of charisma turn negative occurs at higher levels of charisma when adjustment is high.

The empirical study of human behaviour from mid-20th century to date has mainly developed by looking at a normative model of decision making. In particular Subjective Expected Utility (SEU) decision making, which stems from the subjective expected utility theory of <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref59\">Savage (1954)</xref> that itself extended the analysis by <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref70\">Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944)</xref>. On this view, the cognitive psychology of decision making precisely reflects the conceptual structure of formal decision theory. This article shows that there is an alternative way to understand decision making by recovering Newell and Simon’s account of problem solving, developed in the framework of bounded rationality, and inserting it into the more recent research program of embodied cognition. Herbert Simon emphasized the importance of problem solving and differentiated it from decision making, which he considered a phase downstream of the former. Moreover according to Simon the centre of gravity of the rationality of the action lies in the ability to adapt. And the centre of gravity of adaptation is not so much in the internal environment of the actor as in the pragmatic external environment. The behaviour adapts to external purposes and reveals those characteristics of the system that limit its adaptation. According to <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref61\">Simon (1981)</xref>, in fact, environmental feedback is the most effective factor in modelling human actions in solving a problem. In addition, his notion of <italic>problem space</italic> signifies the possible situations to be searched in order to find that situation which corresponds to the solution. Using the language of embodied cognition, the notion of problem space is about the possible solutions that are enacted in relation to environmental affordances. The correspondence between action and the solution of a problem conceptually bypasses the analytic phase of the decision and limits the role of symbolic representation. In solving any problem, the search for the solution corresponds to acting in ways that involve recursive feedback processes leading up to the final action. From this point of view, the new term <italic>enactive problem solving</italic> summarizes this fusion between bounded and embodied cognition. That problem solving involves bounded cognition means that it is through the problem solver’s enactive interaction with environmental affordances, and especially social affordances that it is possible to construct the processes required for arriving at a solution. Lastly the concept of <italic>enactive problem solving</italic> is also able to explain the mechanisms underlying the adaptive heuristics of rational ecology. Its adaptive function is effective both in practical and motor tasks as well as in abstract and symbolic ones.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Viale","given":"Riccardo"},{"family":"Gallagher","given":"Shaun"},{"family":"Gallese","given":"Vittorio"}],"citation-key":"vialeBoundedRationalityEnactive2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

Much research into the evolutionary origins of these cultural practices has focused on why humans perform rather than watch or listen to dance and music. In this study, we show that movement synchrony among a group of performers predicts the aesthetic appreciation of live dance performances. We developed a choreography that continuously manipulated group synchronization using a defined movement vocabulary based on arm swinging, walking and running. The choreography was performed live to four audiences, as we continuously tracked the performers’ movements, and the spectators’ affective responses. We computed dynamic synchrony among performers using cross recurrence analysis of data from wrist accelerometers, and implicit measures of arousal from spectators’ heart rates. Additionally, a subset of spectators provided continuous ratings of enjoyment and perceived synchrony using tablet computers. Granger causality analyses demonstrate predictive relationships between synchrony, enjoyment ratings and spectator arousal, if audiences form a collectively consistent positive or negative aesthetic evaluation. Controlling for the influence of overall movement acceleration and visual change, we show that dance communicates group coordination via coupled movement dynamics among a group of performers. Our findings are in line with an evolutionary function of dance–and perhaps all performing arts–in transmitting social signals between groups of people. Human movement is the common denominator of dance, music and theatre. Acknowledging the time-sensitive and immediate nature of the performer-spectator relationship, our study makes a significant step towards an aesthetics of joint actions in the performing arts.","author":[{"family":"Vicary","given":"Staci"},{"family":"Sperling","given":"Matthias"}],"citation-key":"vicaryJointActionAesthetics","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Joint action aesthetics","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"villanuevaLanguageProfileMetacognitive2022","abstract":"This study dealt with the students' language profile, metacognitive reading strategies, and reading comprehension performance adopting the descriptive-correlational method of the four hundred forty-six randomly selected students enrolled in the colleges of Forestry, Education, Engineering, Computer Science, and Information Technology in a Philippine State University.

We sought to identify and differentiate HRV circadian patterns in MDD, BPD and healthy controls (HC) while exploring potential physio­ logical mechanisms associated with mood and emotion dysregulation.\nMethods: 24-Hour electrocardiographic recordings were obtained from fifty subjects (16 HC, 18 BPD, 16 MDD). HRV was calculated during sleep and wake periods. Associations with mood and affect measures, and with cognitive emotion regulation strategies and self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation (DERS) were exam­ ined. Participant’s resilience traits were explored in relation to mood and emotion regulation variables.\nResults: Lower diurnal measures of HRV (i.e, RMSSD and HF) were observed in MDD subjects compared to HCs. Decreased HF was observed during wake vs. sleep in MDD patients. HAM-D and negative affect scores negatively correlated with HRV in MDD and BPD respectively. MDD and BPD exhibited a positive relationship between the implementation of emotion regulation strategies and HRV compared to HC. Increased resilience was associated with lower HAM-D and DERS scores in BPD and HC.\nConclusion: HRV alterations characterized by low diurnal cardiac parasympathetic control constitute a potential trait biomarker of major depression and psychiatric vulnerability to depressive episodes in BPD. HRV anomalies in MDD may persist during clinical remission.

Specifically, we investigate reading performance of groups of literate adult readers that differ in reading fluency during a self-paced text reading task. Our results indicate that classical metrics of reading (such as word frequency) do not capture text reading very well, and that classical measures of reading fluency (such as average reading time) distinguish relatively poorly between participant groups.

A handful of scholars have noted that properties thought to be at the core of the reading process do not actually generalize across different languages or from situations single-word reading to connected text reading. Such observations cast doubt on many of the traditional conceptions about reading. In this article, I suggest that the observed heterogeneity in the research is due to misguided conceptions about the reading process. Particularly problematic are the unreﬁned notions about meaning which undergird many reading theories: most psychological theories of reading implicitly assume a kind of elemental token semantics, where words serve as stable units of meaning in a text. This conception of meaning creates major conceptual problems. As an alternative, I argue that reading shoud be rather understood as a form of language use, which circumvents many of the conceptual problems and connects reading to a wider range of linguistic communication. Finally, drawing from Wittgenstein, the concept of “language games” is outlined as an approach to language use that can be operationalized scientiﬁcally to provide a new foundation for reading research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Wallot","given":"Sebastian"}],"citation-key":"wallotCrackingOrthographicCode2014","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

The challenge is how to analyze the interaction of two systems which are not described by the same number of variables. The approach is to combine diﬀerent types and number of time series so that they yield a matched set of data points from which coupling or correlation properties can be estimated.

However, reading speed is not a consistent predictor of text comprehension, when speed and comprehension are measured on the same text within the same reader. This might be due to the somewhat ambiguous nature of reading speed, which is sometimes regarded as a feature of the reading process, and sometimes as a product of that process. We argue that both reading speed and comprehension should be seen as the result of the reading process, and that the process of fluent text reading can instead be described by complexity metrics that quantify aspects of the stability of the reading process. In this article, we introduce complexity metrics in the context of reading and apply them to data from a self-paced reading study. In this study, children and adults read a text silently or aloud and answered comprehension questions after reading. Our results show that recurrence metrics that quantify the degree of temporal structure in reading times yield better prediction of text comprehension compared to reading speed. However, the results for fractal metrics are less clear. Furthermore, prediction of text comprehension is generally strongest and most consistent across silent and oral reading when comprehension scores are normalized by reading speed. Analyses of word length and word frequency indicate that the observed complexity in reading times is not a simple function of the lexical properties of the text, suggesting that text reading might work differently compared to reading of isolated word or sentences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Wallot","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"O'Brien","given":"Beth A."},{"family":"Haussmann","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Kloos","given":"Heidi"},{"family":"Lyby","given":"Marlene S."}],"citation-key":"wallotRoleReadingTime2014","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition","DOI":"10.1037/xlm0000030","ISSN":"1939-1285, 0278-7393","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"1745-1765","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The role of reading time complexity and reading speed in text comprehension.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.apa.org/doi/10.1037/xlm0000030","volume":"40"},{"id":"wallotUnderstandingReadingForm2016","abstract":"Reading research and research on conversation have followed different paths: While the research program for reading committed itself to a relatively static view of language, where objective text properties serve to elicit speciﬁc effects on cognition and behavior of a reader, research on conversation has embraced a language-use perspective, where language is primarily seen as a dynamic, context dependent process. In this essay I contrast these two perspectives, and argue that in order to reach a uniﬁed understanding of natural language e be it reading, talking, or conversing e one needs to adopt a languageuse perspective. Furthermore, I describe how reading can be seen as a form of language-use, and how the current landscape of research on reading can be re-interpreted in terms of a dynamic, context-sensitive perspective on language.

I suggest that every pitch interval between neighboring notes in music represents corresponding movement pattern through interpreting the Doppler effect of sound, which not only provides a possible explanation for the transposition invariance of music, but also integrates music and dance into a common form—rhythmic movements. Accordingly, investigating the origins of music poses the question: why do humans appreciate rhythmic movements? I suggest that human appreciation of rhythmic movements and rhythmic events developed from the natural selection of organisms adapting to the internal and external rhythmic environments. The perception and production of, as well as synchronization with external and internal rhythms are so vital for an organism’s survival and reproduction, that animals have a rhythm-related reward and emotion (RRRE) system. The RRRE system enables the appreciation of rhythmic movements and events, and is integral to the origination of music, dance and speech. The ﬁrst type of rewards and emotions (rhythm-related rewards and emotions, RRREs) are evoked by music and dance, and have biological and social functions, which in turn, promote the evolution of music, dance and speech. These functions also evoke a second type of rewards and emotions, which I name society-related rewards and emotions (SRREs). The neural circuits of RRREs and SRREs develop in species formation and personal growth, with congenital and acquired characteristics, respectively, namely music is the combination of nature and culture. This hypothesis provides probable selection pressures and outlines the evolution of music, dance, and speech. The links between the Doppler effect and the RRREs and SRREs can be empirically tested, making the current hypothesis scientiﬁcally concrete.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Tianyan"}],"citation-key":"wangHypothesisBiologicalOrigins2015","container-title":"Frontiers in Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

Herein we establish, both empirically and theoretically, that for some classes of evolving technology systems, the empirical allometry coefficient a is not constant, but is strongly dependent on the historical time at which the technology system originated. Specifically, we construct an EAR with a time-dependent coefficient, using the evolution of a broad class of military systems, over the last ten centuries, ranging from a medieval bowman to a modern rifleman, from a horse-drawn cannon to a tank. This time-dependent EAR is derived from fundamental considerations involving complexity, scaling, and renormalization group theory.

These measures gauge the extent of interdependence across, rather than within, cognitive components. In this study, we investigated dyslexic and non-dyslexic wordnaming performance in beginning readers and observed that these complexity metrics differentiate reliably between dyslexic and average response times and correlate strongly with the severity of the reading impairment. The direction of change in the introduced metrics suggests that developmental dyslexia resides from dynamical instabilities in the coordination among the many components necessary to read, which could explain why dyslexic readers score below average on so many distinct tasks and modalities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Wijnants","given":"M.

Like all good ideas in cognitive science, however, embodiment immediately came to mean six different things. The most common definitions involve the straight-forward claim that “states of the body modify states of the mind.” However, the implications of embodiment are actually much more radical than this. If cognition can span the brain, body, and the environment, then the “states of mind” of disembodied cognitive science won’t exist to be modified. Cognition will instead be an extended system assembled from a broad array of resources. Taking embodiment seriously therefore requires both new methods and theory. Here we outline four key steps that research programs should follow in order to fully engage with the implications of embodiment. The first step is to conduct a task analysis, which characterizes from a first person perspective the specific task that a perceiving-acting cognitive agent is faced with. The second step is to identify the task-relevant resources the agent has access to in order to solve the task. These resources can span brain, body, and environment. The third step is to identify how the agent can assemble these resources into a system capable of solving the problem at hand. The last step is to test the agent’s performance to confirm that agent is actually using the solution identified in step 3. We explore these steps in more detail with reference to two useful examples (the outfielder problem and the A-not-B error), and introduce how to apply this analysis to the thorny question of language use.

This multiscale coordination should, at least on some scales, play a functional role in facilitating effective collaboration outcomes. To evaluate this, we conducted a study of computer-based CPS with 42 dyads. We used cross-wavelet coherence as a way to examine the degree to which movement coordination is evident at a variety of scales and tested whether the observed coordination was greater than both the amount expected due to chance and due to task demands. We found that coordination at scales less than 2s was greater than expected due to chance and at most scales (except 16s, 1m, and 2m) was greater than expected due to task demands. Lastly, we evaluated whether the degree of coherence at scales less than 2s, and the form of coordination (in terms of relative phase), were predictive of CPS performance. We found that .25s and 1s scales were predictive of performance. When including relative phase, our results suggest that higher in-phase movement coordination at the 1s scale was the strongest predictor of CPS performance.

In making their way in the world, animals regulate their behavior with respect to these possibilities. Reed later developed this ecological conception of agency, following Gibson in conceiving of affordances as action possibilities. However, drawing upon industrial design, architecture, and phenomenology, we argue that affordances are not mere action possibilities but that they can also invite behavior.

However, drawing upon examples from everyday life, it is argued that the concept of affordances does not suffice to account for our behavior. It needs to be complemented by the concept of the field of invitations. We are affective beings—the world always affects us, and it does so in a rich variety of ways.

To do this, we turn to the work of social anthropologist, Tim Ingold, leaning on the notion of enskilment, which proposes that learning is inseparable from doing and place. From this worldview, what is learned is not an established body of knowledge, transmitted into the mind of a passive recipient from an authorised being, but is a progressively deepening embodied-embedded attentiveness, where an individual learns to self-regulate by becoming more responsive to people and environmental features by ‘looking, listening and feeling’. As we discuss, Ingold’s perspectives on enskilment are rooted in the etymological connotations of education—ex-ducere, which roughly means ‘to lead out’. In applying this notion to sport, we unpack three of its entangled components, taskscapes, guided attention, and wayfinding, detailing the implications of each for the growth of enskilled sports performers. To promote the translation of these ideas, in addition to encouraging their inquiry beyond the scope of what is discussed here, sporting examples are threaded throughout the paper.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Woods","given":"Carl T."},{"family":"Rudd","given":"James"},{"family":"Gray","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Davids","given":"Keith"}],"citation-key":"woodsEnskilmentEcologicalAnthropologicalWorldview2021","container-title":"Sports Medicine - Open","container-title-short":"Sports Med - Open","DOI":"10.1186/s40798-021-00326-6","ISSN":"2199-1170, 2198-9761","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"33","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Enskilment: an Ecological-Anthropological Worldview of Skill, Learning and Education in Sport","title-short":"Enskilment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-021-00326-6","volume":"7"},{"id":"wuHowAmusementAnger2019","abstract":"Emotions involve subjective experiences, behavioral performances, and physiological responses.

Affective videos selected from a standardized Chinese database were used to induce amused, fearful, angry, and neutral emotions, while electrocardiogram and self-rated emotional experiences were recorded. Heart rate was signiﬁcantly lower in the amused condition than in the angry, fearful and neutral condition. There were no signiﬁcant differences among the latter three conditions. The root mean square of successive differences, an index of heart rate variability (HRV), was signiﬁcantly larger in the amused condition than in the fearful, neutral, and angry conditions. It was also signiﬁcantly larger in the angry condition than in the fearful condition. There were no signiﬁcant differences between the fearful and neutral, or angry and neutral conditions. These results revealed that: (1) amusement activates the parasympathetic nervous system, and (2) compared with fear, anger is more likely to be linked with parasympathetic activation.

The present research applied embodied cognitive perspective to explore the effect of embodied guidance on insight problem solving and its underlying mechanisms by two experiments.

The results showed that the embodied gestures facilitate the participants’ performance. Experiment 2 investigated how embodied attention guidance affects insight problem solving. The results showed that participants performed better in prototypical guidance condition. Experiment 2a adopted the Duncker’s radiation problem to explore how embodied behavior and prototypical guidance inﬂuence problem solving by attention tracing techniques. Experiment 2b aimed to further examine whether implicit attention transfer was the real cause which resulted in participants over-performing in prototypical guidance condition in Experiment 2a. The results demonstrated that overt physical motion was unnecessary for individuals to experience the beneﬁts of embodied guidance in problem solving, which supported the reciprocal relation hypothesis of saccades and attention. In addition, the questionnaire completed after experiments showed that participants did not realize the relation between guidance and insight problem solving. Taken together, the current study provided further evidence for that embodied gesture and embodied attention both facilitated the insight problem solving and the facilitation is implicit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Xing","given":"Qiang"},{"family":"Rong","given":"Cuiliang"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Zheyi"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Yanfeng"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhonglu"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Xue"}],"citation-key":"xingEffectEmbodiedGuidance2018","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

In Experiment 1 co-located collaborators judged each other’s emotions after playing a game that required cooperative data collection and analysis. Their judgements were largely inaccurate and based on their own emotions, suggesting limited emotion understanding. Experiment 2 explored if this could be overcome by making collaborators aware of each other’s emotions. Co-located and remote collaborators played a cooperative puzzle-solving game under conditions of awareness or no awareness. Awareness was manipulated by making collaborators share their self-reported emotions during key moments of their game play. Both remote and co-located collaborators improved their performance after sharing their emotions. However, unlike co-located collaborators, remote collaborators also improved their understanding of each other’s emotions and experienced more positive affect. We conclude by discussing the content of collaborators’ emotion understanding and the probable mechanisms underlying the observed effects of being made aware of a partner’s emotions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Xolocotzin Eligio","given":"Ulises"},{"family":"Ainsworth","given":"Shaaron E."},{"family":"Crook","given":"Charles K."}],"citation-key":"xolocotzineligioEmotionUnderstandingPerformance2012","container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2012.06.001","ISSN":"07475632","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",11]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","page":"2046-2054","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Emotion understanding and performance during computer-supported collaboration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0747563212001513","volume":"28"},{"id":"yacavoneFilmPhenomenologyArt2016","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Yacavone","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"yacavoneFilmPhenomenologyArt2016","container-title":"New Literary History","container-title-short":"New Literary History","DOI":"10.1353/nlh.2016.0001","ISSN":"1080-661X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"159-185","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Film and the Phenomenology of Art: Reappraising Merleau-Ponty on Cinema as Form, Medium, and Expression","title-short":"Film and the Phenomenology of Art","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/626118","volume":"47"},{"id":"yilmazEmbodimentCinematographerEmotional2023","abstract":"We investigate the relationship between camera movement techniques and cognitive responses in audiences, reporting on an experiment exploring the effects of different camera movement methods on viewers' degree of immersion and emotional response.

Discourse comprehension theories and a recent theory of perceptual event segmentation both suggest that comprehenders monitor situational features such as characters’ goals in order to update these representations at natural boundaries in activity. However, the converging predictions of these theories had not previously been tested directly. Two studies provided evidence that changes in situational features such as characters, their locations, interactions with objects, and goals are related to the segmentation of events in both narrative texts and films. A third study indicated that clauses with event boundaries are read more slowly than other clauses, and that changes in situational features partially mediate this relationship. A final study suggested that the predictability of incoming information influences reading rate and possibly event segmentation. Taken together, these results suggest that processing situational changes during comprehension is an important determinant of how one segments ongoing activity into events, and that this segmentation is related to the control of processing during reading.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Zacks","given":"Jeffrey M."},{"family":"Speer","given":"Nicole K."},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Jeremy R."}],"citation-key":"zacksSegmentationReadingFilm2009","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: General","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Psychology: General","DOI":"10.1037/a0015305","ISSN":"1939-2222, 0096-3445","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",5]]},"language":"en","page":"307-327","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Segmentation in reading and film comprehension.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0015305","volume":"138"},{"id":"zahnHeartRateVariability2016","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Zahn","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Adams","given":"Johanna"},{"family":"Krohn","given":"Jeanette"},{"family":"Wenzel","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Mann","given":"Caroline G."},{"family":"Gomille","given":"Lara K."},{"family":"Jacobi-Scherbening","given":"Vera"},{"family":"Kubiak","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"zahnHeartRateVariability2016","container-title":"Biological Psychology","container-title-short":"Biological Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopsycho.2015.12.007","ISSN":"03010511","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",3]]},"language":"en","page":"9-26","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Heart rate variability and self-control—A meta-analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0301051115300995","volume":"115"},{"id":"zarza-rebolloCanIncreasedInteroception2019","abstract":"The benefits of regular physical exercise do not only concern physical wellness, but also seem to influence cognitive function.

Analyses and modelling of empirically observed patterns of biological coordination often focus either on ensemble-level statistics in large-scale systems with many components, or on detailed dynamics in small-scale systems with few components. The two approaches have proceeded largely independent of each other. To bridge this gap between levels and scales, we have recently conducted a human experiment of mid-scale social coordination specifically designed to reveal coordination at multiple levels (ensemble, subgroups and dyads) simultaneously. Based on this experiment, the present work shows that, surprisingly, a single system of equations captures key observations at all relevant levels. It also connects empirically validated models of large- and small-scale biological coordination—the Kuramoto and extended Haken–Kelso–Bunz (HKB) models—and the hallmark phenomena that each is known to capture. For example, it exhibits both multistability and metastability observed in small-scale empirical research (via the second-order coupling and symmetry breaking in extended HKB) and the growth of biological complexity as a function of scale (via the scalability of the Kuramoto model). Only by incorporating both of these features simultaneously can we reproduce the essential coordination behaviour observed in our experiment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Mengsen"},{"family":"Beetle","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Kelso","given":"J.

Rhythmic coordination was studied in ensembles of eight people, with differences in movement frequency (‘diversity’) manipulated within the ensemble. Quantitative change in diversity led to qualitative changes in coordination, a critical value separating re´ gimes of integration and segregation between groups. Metastable and multifrequency coordination between participants enabled communication across segregated groups within the ensemble, without destroying overall order.

It was hypothesized that there are higher levels of movement synchrony in the analyzed therapy sessions compared to pseudo-interactions. Further, we tested whether higher levels of movement synchrony correlate with stronger patients’ symptom reduction and whether higher movement synchrony predicts higher postsession ratings. A total of 356 sessions from 16 completed psychotherapies of adolescent patients with BPD were analyzed. Movement synchrony was assessed with motion energy analysis and an index of synchrony was calculated by lagged cross-correlation analysis. As hypothesized, the ﬁndings support higher levels of movement synchrony in therapy sessions compared to pseudo-interactions (Cohen’s d = 0.85). Additionally, a correlation of movement synchrony with better therapy outcome was found (standardized beta = −0.43 indicating stronger personality functioning impairment reduction).

Cognitive science, psychology, and neuroscience studies suggest that in such planned coordination, adjusting one’s own actions based on other roles is crucial for high task performance. However, the mechanisms of complex and dynamically planned coordination, such as non-verbal group behavior with three or more members, remain to be fully investigated. This study introduced a coordinated drawing task in a triad, quantitatively analyzed non-verbal group behavior based on sharing heterogeneous roles, and investigated an important role. Participant triads engaged in the task repeatedly by operating reels to change thread tensions and moving a pen connected to the three threads to draw an equilateral triangle. Then, the three roles (pulling, relaxing, and adjusting) had to be shared. The pulling and relaxing roles served to move the pen as if an operator pulled it closer to the hand and to support the pen’s movement, respectively. However, these roles alone could not draw a side considering the task specification. The adjusting role needed to change the tension flexibly and maintain an overall balance. In the experiment, we measured the pen positions and tensions, and established statistical models to fit the analyzed data. The results estimated that the action in the adjusting role was related to the improved performance of faster drawing on a side. This role may moderately intervene in the actions by the other roles and fine-tune without disturbing the pen’s smooth movement while avoiding great pen deviation. Our findings may suggest the crucial role as a facilitator that handles resiliently in non-verbal coordinated behavior of a triad, and contribute to our understanding of social interactions.","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2022.890205","ISSN":"1664-1078","journalAbbreviation":"Front.

The main elements that affected the strategies are discussed, and a 3D evolution model is established. The evolutionary stability strategy (ESS) and stable conditions were analyzed subsequently. Numerical simulation results were obtained through MATLAB simulation, and they manifested that leaders play an important role in exchanging information with other agents, accepting agents’ state information, and sending messages to agents. Then, with the positivity of receiving and feeding back messages for followers, implementing message communication is proﬁtable for the system, and the high positivity can accelerate the exchange of information. At the behavior level, reducing costs can strengthen the punishment of impeding the exchange of information and improve the positivity of collaboration to facilitate the evolutionary convergence toward the ideal state. Finally, the EGT results revealed that the possibility of collaboration between loners and others is improved, and the rewards are increased, thereby promoting the implementation of message communication that encourages leaders to send all messages, improve the feedback positivity of followers, and reduce the hindering degree of loners.","container-title":"Games","DOI":"10.3390/g12040075","ISSN":"2073-4336","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"Games","language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"75","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dynamic Model of Collaboration in Multi-Agent System Based on Evolutionary Game Theory","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4336/12/4/75","volume":"12","author":[{"family":"Gou","given":"Zhuozhuo"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Yansong"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,30]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,3]]},"citation-key":"gouDynamicModelCollaboration2021a","library":"My Library","citekey":"gouDynamicModelCollaboration2021a"},{"id":"ichikawaForceBasedModelingHeterogeneous2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Group coordination is deﬁned as interactions with other members to implement a task that is difﬁcult to do alone or to achieve higher performance than an individual. Meanwhile, the adjustment process in coordination is not uniquely determined because each individual has many degrees of freedom. It is more difﬁcult to explain and model complex and dynamic coordination, such as nonverbal behavior of three or more members than pair or verbal interaction. Hence, we previously introduced a coordinated drawing task and conducted the behavioral experiment. The triads operated reels to change the tensions of threads connected to a pen, shared three heterogeneous roles (pulling, relaxing, and adjusting), and moved the pen to draw an equilateral triangle. The results indicated that the adjusting role was related to high task performance by helping resiliently without disturbing the pen’s smooth movement while avoiding great pen deviation. However, this experiment alone cannot explain details of the adjustment process of tension. To supplement these ﬁndings, this study formulated the three roles using equations of motion. The multi-agent simulation results showed that the adjusting role might use the degree of pen deviation reﬂected by the others’ motor information, such as the operating procedures and forces, to change the tension and draw at least three sides. Although it is necessary to consider that we used the experimental task, our study contributes to the fundamental understanding of resilient adjustment in coordination by sharing heterogeneous roles as the ﬁrst step.","container-title":"New Generation Computing","DOI":"10.1007/s00354-024-00277-y","ISSN":"0288-3635, 1882-7055","journalAbbreviation":"New Gener.

This reciprocation of ties leads to the formation of interaction patterns that are reciprocated dyads (two individuals connected reciprocally) and triads (three individuals connected reciprocally). In this study, we use an agent-based model to explore how such reciprocated dyadic and triadic patterns emerge from self-reinforced appreciation between peers in a small group.\nMethods:  The model assumes that the agents’ decisions to interact depend on how their self-appreciation compares to their appreciations of their peers (peer-appreciation). These comparisons are competitive in that an agent seek to increase its appreciation in relation to its peers. As a consequence, agents change their self-appreciation and appreciation towards their peers depending on their sensitivity to the competitive comparison.\nResults:  When agents’ sensitivity to competitive comparisons is low, the most common patterns of appreciation are egalitarian triads (all three agents appreciate each other), while for moderate sensitivity, leadership-type patterns emerge (one agent connected strongly to two other unconnected agents). When sensitivity is high, strong reciprocally connected dyads emerge. The model thus predicts thus a transition from egalitarian triads to strong dyads as agents’ sensitivity to competitive comparisons increases.\nConclusions:  The structural similarity between patterns emerging as model results and patterns reported in empirical research suggests that: (1) reciprocation based on appreciation is a strong candidate for explaining the formation of such patterns, and (2) individual sensitivity to competitive comparisons of appreciation may be a key factor that can be used to the tune dynamics of interaction in small groups.","container-title":"Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling","DOI":"10.1186/s40294-016-0035-6","ISSN":"2194-3206","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Complex Adapt Syst Model","language":"en","page":"24","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Formation of reciprocal appreciation patterns in small groups: an agent-based model","title-short":"Formation of reciprocal appreciation patterns in small groups","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1186/s40294-016-0035-6","volume":"4","author":[{"family":"Koponen","given":"Ismo T."},{"family":"Nousiainen","given":"Maija"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,30]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12]]},"citation-key":"koponenFormationReciprocalAppreciation2016a","library":"My Library","citekey":"koponenFormationReciprocalAppreciation2016a"},{"id":"grossFacetsEmotionalExpressivity1995a","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Using an explicit model of emotion, we developed the Berkeley Expressivity Questionnaire.

Can one be both very happy and very angry at the same time, or shift quickly between these states? And which emotion should determine the behaviour of an agent? The present paper explores an alternative where dimensional emotions spread in a crowd and the emotional state of an agent equals its location in the valencearousal space, corresponding to a single emotion. We propose an agent-based model that is an extension of the ASCRIBE model. Furthermore, building on recent work that found an attention bias in participants toward emotionally salient stimuli, we examine the effects of attention bias in the context of emotion contagion at the crowd level.","container-title":"Advances in Practical Applications of Agents, Multi-Agent Systems, and Social Good.

The aim of the present paper is to validate an agent-based model of emotion contagion at the level of group emotion, by comparing simulations against the emotional development of real people in small groups. To study the effect of emotion contagion, the participants interacted via a video call, where they were virtually placed in different social environments while they played a quiz. This allowed the exchange of emotion among all, some or none of the participants. The patterns of emotional development in the empirical results supported our hypotheses based on literature of emotion contagion and social norms. Further, the simulations with the complete model resembled many of these patterns. When emotion contagion was disabled in the model, the resemblance decreased. These results give a ﬁrst indication that emotion contagion occurs in groups that meet via video calls, and can in-part be predicted by the proposed model of emotion contagion. Yet, further study with a larger and more diverse empirical sample is needed, as well as comparisons across contagion mechanisms, to draw stronger conclusions and ultimately justify societal application.","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","DOI":"10.1109/TAFFC.2023.3272031","ISSN":"1949-3045, 2371-9850","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"IEEE Trans.

Previous meta-analyses have indicated that personality traits are one of the best predictors. Still, these past results indicate only a moderate relationship, weaker than suggested by several lines of reasoning. This may be because of commensurability, where researchers have grouped together substantively disparate measures in their analyses. In this article, the authors review and address this problem directly, focusing on individual measures of personality (e.g., the Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness Personality Inventory; P. T. Costa & R. R. McCrae, 1992) and categories of SWB (e.g., life satisfaction). In addition, the authors take a multivariate approach, assessing how much variance personality traits account for individually as well as together. Results indicate that different personality and SWB scales can be substantively different and that the relationship between the two is typically much larger (e.g., 4 times) than previous meta-analyses have indicated. Total SWB variance accounted for by personality can reach as high as 39% or 63% disattenuated. These results also speak to meta-analyses in general and the need to account for scale differences once a sufficient research base has been generated.","container-title":"Psychological Bulletin","DOI":"10.1037/0033-2909.134.1.138","ISSN":"1939-1455, 0033-2909","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Psychological Bulletin","language":"en","page":"138-161","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Refining the relationship between personality and subjective well-being.","URL":"https://doi.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0033-2909.134.1.138","volume":"134","author":[{"family":"Steel","given":"Piers"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Shultz","given":"Jonas"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,30]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",1]]},"citation-key":"steelRefiningRelationshipPersonality2008","library":"My Library","citekey":"steelRefiningRelationshipPersonality2008"},{"id":"sunGeneralizedCompetencyModel2020","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is an essential skill in the 21st century.

Each facet has two sub-facets, which in turn, have multiple verbal and nonverbal indicators. We validated our model in two empirical studies involving triadic CPS, but in very different contexts – middle-school students playing an educational game in a 3-hour, face-to-face session vs. college students engaging in a visual programming task for 20 minutes via videoconferencing. We used principal component analysis to investigate whether the empirical data aligned with our theorized model. Correlational analyses provided evidence on the orthogonality of the facets and their independence to individual differences in prior knowledge, intelligence and personality and regression analyses indicated that the facets predicted both subjective and objective outcome measures controlling for several covariates. Thus we provide initial evidence for the convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity of our model by using two different CPS contexts and student populations. This shows promise towards generalizing across various human-human CPS interactive environments.","container-title":"Computers & Education","DOI":"10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103672","ISSN":"03601315","journalAbbreviation":"Computers & Education","language":"en","page":"103672","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Towards a generalized competency model of collaborative problem solving","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0360131519302258","volume":"143","author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Shute","given":"Valerie J."},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Yonehiro","given":"Jade"},{"family":"Duran","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"D'Mello","given":"Sidney"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,30]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"citation-key":"sunGeneralizedCompetencyModel2020","library":"My Library","citekey":"sunGeneralizedCompetencyModel2020"},{"id":"spoelstraAgentBasedSimulationGroup2008","type":"chapter","abstract":"We construct groups of simulated learners that model the behaviour of humans acting in various learning environments, with the aims of studying group learning and focusing on the effects of different goal structures on individuals and groups of learners.

Beginning with the first published work on the ANPS in 2003, individual differences on the ANPS measures of these six primary emotional systems have been consistently linked to Big Five personality traits. From a theoretical perspective, these primary emotional systems arising from subcortical regions, shed light on the nature of the Big Five personality traits from an evolutionary perspective, because each of these primary emotional systems represent a tool for survival endowing mammalian species with inherited behavioral programs to react appropriately to complex environments. The present work revisited 21 available samples where both ANPS and Big Five measures have been administered. Our meta-analytical analysis provides solid evidence that high SEEKING relates to high Openness to Experience, high PLAY to high Extraversion, high CARE/low ANGER to high Agreeableness and high FEAR/SADNESS/ANGER to high Neuroticism. This seems to be true regardless of the ANPS inventory chosen, although much more work is needed in this area. Associations between primary emotional systems and Conscientiousness were in the lower effect size area across all six primary emotions, thereby supporting the idea that Conscientiousness rather seems to be less directly related with the subcortical primary emotions and likely is the most cognitive/cortical personality construct out of the Big Five. In sum, the present work underlines the idea that individual differences in primary emotional systems represent evolutionarily ancient foundations of human personality, given their a) meaningful links to the prominent Big Five model and b) their origins lying in subcortical areas of the human brain.","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-021-84366-8","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Sci Rep","language":"en","page":"7453","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A meta-analysis on individual differences in primary emotional systems and Big Five personality traits","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84366-8","volume":"11","author":[{"family":"Marengo","given":"Davide"},{"family":"Davis","given":"Kenneth L."},{"family":"Gradwohl","given":"Gökçe Özkarar"},{"family":"Montag","given":"Christian"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,30]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,2]]},"citation-key":"marengoMetaanalysisIndividualDifferences2021","library":"My Library","citekey":"marengoMetaanalysisIndividualDifferences2021"},{"id":"koponenAgentBasedModelDiscourse2018a","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Discourse patterns in a small group are assumed to form largely through the group’s internal social dynamics when group members compete for floor in discourse. Here we approach such discourse pattern formation through the agent-based model (ABM). In the ABM introduced here the agents’ interactions and participation in discussions are dependent on the agents’ inherent potential activity to participate in discussion and on realised, externalised activity, discursivity. The discourse patterns are assumed to be outcomes of peerto-peer comparison events, where agents competitively compare their activities and discursivities, and where activities also a ect agents’ cooperation in increasing the discursivity, i.e. floor for discourse. These two e ects and their influence on discourse pattern formation are parameterised as comptetivity α and cooperativity λ. The discourse patterns are here based on the agents’ discursivity. The patterns in groups of four agents up to seven agents are characterised through triadic census (i.e. though counting triadic sub-patterns). The cases of low competitivity α is shown to give rise to fully connected egalitarian, triadic patterns, which with increasing competitivity are transformed to strong dyadic patterns. An increase in cooperativity λ enhances the emergence of egalitarian triads and helps to maintain the formation of fully and partially connected triadic pattern also in cases of high competitivity. In larger groups of six and seven agents, isolation becomes common, in contrast to groups of four agents where isolation is relatively rare. These results are in concordance with known empirical findings of discourse and participation patterns in small groups.","container-title":"Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation","DOI":"10.18564/jasss.3648","ISSN":"1460-7425","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"JASSS","language":"en","page":"1","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An Agent-Based Model of Discourse Pattern Formation in Small Groups of Competing and Cooperating Members","URL":"http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/21/2/1.html","volume":"21","author":[{"family":"Koponen","given":"Ismo T."},{"family":"Nousiainen","given":"Maija"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,30]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"citation-key":"koponenAgentBasedModelDiscourse2018a","library":"My Library","citekey":"koponenAgentBasedModelDiscourse2018a"},{"id":"mallickWhatYouSay2024a","type":"article-journal","abstract":"With the expansive growth of AI’s capabilities in recent years, researchers have been tasked with developing and improving human-centered AI collaborations, necessitating the creation of human–AI teams (HATs).

One core difference is that humans naturally leverage a positive emotional tone during communication to convey their confidence or lack thereof to convey doubt in their ability to complete a task. Yet, this communication strategy must be explicitly designed in order for an AI teammate to be human-centered. In this mixed-methods study, 45 participants completed a study examining how human teammates interpret the behaviors of their AI teammates when they express different positive emotions via specific words/phrases. Quantitative results show that, based on corresponding behaviors, AI teammates were able to use displays of emotion to increase trust in AI teammates and the positive mood of the human teammate. Additionally, our qualitative findings indicate that participants preferred their AI teammates to increase the intensity of their displayed emotions to help reduce the perceived risk of their AI teammate’s behavior. When taken in sum, these findings describe the relevance of AI teammates expressing intensities of emotion while performing various behavioral decisions as a continued means to provide social support to the wider team and better task performance.","container-title":"International Journal of Human-Computer Studies","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhcs.2024.103355","ISSN":"10715819","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Human-Computer Studies","language":"en","page":"103355","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"What you say vs what you do: Utilizing positive emotional expressions to relay AI teammate intent within human–AI teams","title-short":"What you say vs what you do","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1071581924001381","volume":"192","author":[{"family":"Mallick","given":"Rohit"},{"family":"Flathmann","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Duan","given":"Wen"},{"family":"Schelble","given":"Beau G."},{"family":"McNeese","given":"Nathan J."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12]]},"citation-key":"mallickWhatYouSay2024a","library":"My Library","citekey":"mallickWhatYouSay2024a"},{"id":"dindarWhatDoesPhysiological2020","type":"article-journal","abstract":"There is a growing body of research on physiological synchrony (PS) in Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS).

This article aims to investigate, using control-value theory (Pekrun, 2006) as a frame of reference, how task-achievement appraisals impact both self-experienced emotions and the perception of socio-cognitive processes. An experimental study involving 28 pairs of participants playing a collaborative problem-solving computer puzzle game was carried out. Depending on the experimental conditions, participants received different false feedback about group task mastery and ranking aiming at skewing in different ways how they appraised task achievement. At the end of the task, they reported self and partner’s emotions as well as their perception of their socio-cognitive exchanges. The results indicate that 1) participants experienced a large variety of achievement emotions and some of them appear more closely related to specific task-achievement appraisals, 2) achievement emotions do not mediate the relationship between task-achievement appraisals and the perception of socio-cognitive processes, 3) the level of self-experienced activation as well as the perception of activation in the partner mediate the relationship between task-achievement appraisals and the perception of socio-cognitive processes and could be used as a heuristic of socio-cognitive collaborative involvement by problem solvers, 4) partner’s emotions such as gratitude appear to increase the perception of socio-cognitive processes through the reinforcement of group mastery goal.","container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2020.106267","ISSN":"07475632","journalAbbreviation":"Computers in Human Behavior","language":"en","page":"106267","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Achievement appraisals, emotions and socio-cognitive processes: How they interplay in collaborative problem-solving?","title-short":"Achievement appraisals, emotions and socio-cognitive processes","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0747563220300236","volume":"107","author":[{"family":"Avry","given":"Sunny"},{"family":"Chanel","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Bétrancourt","given":"Mireille"},{"family":"Molinari","given":"Gaëlle"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6]]},"citation-key":"avryAchievementAppraisalsEmotions2020","library":"My Library","citekey":"avryAchievementAppraisalsEmotions2020"},{"id":"borgeUnpackingSocioMetacognitiveSenseMaking2019","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This study explores the dynamics between socio-metacognitive communication patterns and collaborative processes, as students engage in collaborative discussions about course concepts.

Our results show that physiological synchrony of skin conductance measures and eletromyographic measures of the corrugator supercilii develops spontaneously among team members during this cooperative production task. Moreover, high team synchrony is found indicative of team cohesion, while low team synchrony is found indicative of a teams' decision to adopt a new behavior across multiple production sessions.

We explore the effect of visualization using physiological cues that allow users to interpret emotional behaviors of remote parties with whom they are interacting in real time. The proposed visual representation allows users to infer emotional patterns from physiological cues that can potentially inﬂuence their communication approach toward a more aggressive style or maintain passive and peaceful interaction. We conducted a study involving participants who were paired up for a collaborative assessment task, interacting via voice only, videoconference, or a visual representation of the physiological measurements. Participants perceived the usage of our visual representation with higher group cohesiveness than using voice-only interaction. Further analysis shows that the visual representation significantly increases the positive affect score (i.e., participants are perceived to be more alert and demonstrate less distress) during remote collaboration. We discuss the possibilities of the proposed visual representation to support empathic communication during remote collaboration, and the beneﬁts to the remote partners of having positive affect and group cohesiveness.","container-title":"Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments","DOI":"10.1162/PRES_a_00168","ISSN":"1054-7460","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments","language":"en","page":"90-107","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Role of Physiological Cues during Remote Collaboration","URL":"https://direct.mit.edu/pvar/article/23/1/90-107/18872","volume":"23","author":[{"family":"Tan","given":"Chiew Seng Sean"},{"family":"Luyten","given":"Kris"},{"family":"Van Den Bergh","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Schöning","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Coninx","given":"Karin"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",2,1]]},"citation-key":"tanRolePhysiologicalCues2014a","library":"My Library","citekey":"tanRolePhysiologicalCues2014a"},{"id":"tomashinInterpersonalPhysiologicalSynchrony2022a","type":"article-journal","abstract":"A key emergent property of group social dynamic is synchrony–the coordination of actions, emotions, or physiological processes between group members. Despite this fact and the inherent nested structure of groups, little research has assessed physiological synchronization between group members from a multi-level perspective, thus limiting a full understanding of the dynamics between members. To address this gap of knowledge we re-analyzed a large dataset (N = 261) comprising physiological and psychological data that were collected in two laboratory studies that involved two different social group tasks. In both studies, following the group task, members reported their experience of group cohesion via questionnaires. We utilized a nonlinear analysis method-multidimensional recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis that allowed us to represent physiological synchronization in cardiological interbeat intervals between group members at the individual-level and at the group-level. We found that across studies and their conditions, the change in physiological synchrony from baseline to group interaction predicted a psychological sense of group cohesion. This result was evident both at the individual and the group levels and was not modiﬁed by the context of the interaction. The individual- and group-level effects were highly correlated. These results indicate that the relationship between synchrony and cohesion is a multilayered construct. We re-afﬁrm the role of physiological synchrony for cohesion in groups. Future studies are needed to crystallize our understanding of the differences and similarities between synchrony at the individual-level and synchrony at the group level to illuminate under which conditions one of these levels has primacy, or how they interact.","container-title":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","DOI":"10.3389/fnhum.2022.903407","ISSN":"1662-5161","journalAbbreviation":"Front.

The dynamical approach enables social psychology to advance as a precise science while preserving the basic insights that launched the ﬁeld over a century ago.","container-title":"Social and Personality Psychology Compass","DOI":"10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00319.x","ISSN":"17519004","issue":"11","language":"en","license":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/tdm_license_1.1","page":"1018-1030","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dynamical Social Psychology: Complexity and Coherence in Human Experience: Complexity and Coherence in Human Experience","title-short":"Dynamical Social Psychology","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00319.x","volume":"4","author":[{"family":"Wiese","given":"Susan L."},{"family":"Vallacher","given":"Robin R."},{"family":"Strawinska","given":"Urszula"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",11]]},"citation-key":"wieseDynamicalSocialPsychology2010a","library":"My Library","citekey":"wieseDynamicalSocialPsychology2010a"},{"id":"molinariEmotionFeedbackComputerMediated2013a","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Emotions play a crucial role in collaboration.

Attempts to deﬁne and measure charisma have frequently treated it as a complex construct consisting of multiple components. However, little work has been done to develop a theoretical model that oﬀers a parsimonious rationale explaining why certain leadership attributes are considered “charismatic” while others are not, or how these attributes combine to produce charismatic eﬀects. Addressing these issues, we present a model that situates emotion as the primary variable in the charismatic process. We use recent research on the moral emotions to frame a theory of followership-relevant emotions (FREs) that describes how leaders use emotions such as compassion, admiration, and anger to compel their followers to act. We then discuss the Elicit-Channel (EC) model of charismatic leadership, positing that the charismatic relationship is a ﬁve-step, cyclical process. In the EC model, leaders elicit highly motivating emotions from their followers and then channel those emotions to produce action that, if successful, results in outcomes such as positive aﬀect and trust. These outcomes then enable the leader to continue the cycle, eliciting emotion once more. We conclude by oﬀering a research agenda, addressing potential methodological concerns, and discussing future directions.","container-title":"The Leadership Quarterly","DOI":"10.1016/j.leaqua.2017.12.008","ISSN":"10489843","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"The Leadership Quarterly","language":"en","page":"58-69","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Charismatic leadership: Eliciting and channeling follower emotions","title-short":"Charismatic leadership","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1048984317300693","volume":"29","author":[{"family":"Sy","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Horton","given":"Calen"},{"family":"Riggio","given":"Ronald"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2]]},"citation-key":"syCharismaticLeadershipEliciting2018a","library":"My Library","citekey":"syCharismaticLeadershipEliciting2018a"},{"id":"tschacherSharingNowSocial2018a","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Objective: The social present is a novel descriptor of dyadic nowness and social sharing, extending research on individual nowness (James’s [1890] specious present) to the interpersonal and intersubjective domain. We wished to connect this descriptor to personality attributes.\nMethod: We deﬁne the social present by the duration of signiﬁcant nonverbal synchrony, based on the phenomenon of movement synchrony that generally emerges in social interactions. It is thus an implicit and objective measure that can be implemented by automated video analyses. In this study, 168 healthy participants were invited to verbal conversations in same-sex dyads. We analyzed the associations of the social present with personality attributes and interaction types (competition, cooperation, fun task).\nResults: The average duration of the social present was 6.0 seconds, highest in competitive interactions and in male-male dyads. People with higher Openness to Experience, higher avoidant attachment, and lower narcissistic interpersonal styles showed extended social present in their interactions.\nConclusions: The concept of the social present extends personality attributes to the interpersonal domain and to intersubjectivity. The social present may be computed based on movement synchrony but also prosodic or physiological synchronies. We foresee implications for health-related interactions such as psychotherapy, where therapeutic presence is an essential property of alliance.","container-title":"Journal of Personality","DOI":"10.1111/jopy.12298","ISSN":"0022-3506, 1467-6494","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Personality","language":"en","license":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","page":"129-138","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sharing the Now in the Social Present: Duration of Nonverbal Synchrony Is Linked With Personality","title-short":"Sharing the Now in the Social Present","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12298","volume":"86","author":[{"family":"Tschacher","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Ramseyer","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Koole","given":"Sander L."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4]]},"citation-key":"tschacherSharingNowSocial2018a","library":"My Library","citekey":"tschacherSharingNowSocial2018a"},{"id":"troncosoMovingLabInvestigating2023a","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Empathy is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that plays a crucial role in human social interactions. Recent developments in social neuroscience have provided valuable insights into the neural underpinnings and bodily mechanisms underlying empathy. This methodology often prioritizes precision, replicability, internal validity, and confound control. However, fully understanding the complexity of empathy seems unattainable by solely relying on artificial and controlled laboratory settings, while overlooking a comprehensive view of empathy through an ecological experimental approach. In this article, we propose articulating an integrative theoretical and methodological framework based on the 5E approach (the “E”s stand for\n              embodied, embedded, enacted, emotional, and extended perspectives of empathy\n              ), highlighting the relevance of studying empathy as an active interaction between embodied agents, embedded in a shared real-world environment. In addition, we illustrate how a novel multimodal approach including mobile brain and body imaging (MoBi) combined with phenomenological methods, and the implementation of interactive paradigms in a natural context, are adequate procedures to study empathy from the 5E approach. In doing so, we present the Empirical 5E approach (E5E) as an integrative scientific framework to bridge brain/body and phenomenological attributes in an interbody interactive setting. Progressing toward an E5E approach can be crucial to understanding empathy in accordance with the complexity of how it is experienced in the real world.","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1119469","ISSN":"1664-1078","journalAbbreviation":"Front.

The present research advances highresolution measurement of team processes by introducing a technological application—the Communication Analysis Tool (CAT)—that captures fine-grained interactions in real workplace contexts. We introduce four core features of CAT: (a) customized coding measures, (b) session-based feedback on interrater reliability, (c) visualization and feedback options for displaying team dynamics, and (d) an export function to conduct advanced statistical analyses on effective team processes. We illustrate these core features using data from an organizational field project on multidisciplinary teams tasked with diagnosing patients with uncommon and highly complex medical conditions.","container-title":"Small Group Research","DOI":"10.1177/1046496420904126","ISSN":"1046-4964, 1552-8278","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Small Group Research","language":"en","page":"303-341","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Capturing Team Dynamics in the Wild: The Communication Analysis Tool","title-short":"Capturing Team Dynamics in the Wild","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1046496420904126","volume":"51","author":[{"family":"Klonek","given":"Florian E."},{"family":"Meinecke","given":"Annika L."},{"family":"Hay","given":"Georgia"},{"family":"Parker","given":"Sharon K."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6]]},"citation-key":"klonekCapturingTeamDynamics2020a","library":"My Library","citekey":"klonekCapturingTeamDynamics2020a"},{"id":"oregPersonalityCharismaticLeadership2015a","type":"article-journal","abstract":"We adopt an interactionist perspective and extend previous work on personality and charismatic leadership by considering the relationship between them across contexts.

The degree to which this physiological synchrony occurs is related to attentional engagement. Factors that can inﬂuence attention, such as instructions, salience of the narrative stimulus and characteristics of the individual, affect physiological synchrony. The demonstrability of synchrony depends on the amount of data used in the analysis. We investigated how demonstrability of physiological synchrony varies with varying group size and stimulus duration. Thirty participants watched six 10 min movie clips while their HR and EDA were monitored using wearable sensors (Movisens EdaMove 4 and Wahoo Tickr, respectively). We calculated inter-subject correlations as a measure of synchrony. Group size and stimulus duration were varied by using data from subsets of the participants and movie clips in the analysis. We found that for HR, higher synchrony correlated signiﬁcantly with the number of answers correct for questions about the movie, conﬁrming that physiological synchrony is associated with attention. For both HR and EDA, with increasing amounts of data used, the percentage of participants with signiﬁcant synchrony increased. Importantly, we found that it did not matter how the amount of data was increased. Increasing the group size or increasing the stimulus duration led to the same results. Initial comparisons with results from other studies suggest that our results do not only apply to our speciﬁc set of stimuli and participants. All in all, the current work can act as a guideline for future research, indicating the amount of data minimally needed for robust analysis of synchrony based on inter-subject correlations.","container-title":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s23063006","ISSN":"1424-8220","issue":"6","journalAbbreviation":"Sensors","language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"3006","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Robustness of Physiological Synchrony in Wearable Electrodermal Activity and Heart Rate as a Measure of Attentional Engagement to Movie Clips","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/6/3006","volume":"23","author":[{"family":"Stuldreher","given":"Ivo V."},{"family":"Van Erp","given":"Jan B.

At first glance, non-insight appears to depend on the availability and taxation of cognitive resources to execute the step-by-step approach, whereas insight does not, or to a lesser extent. However, this remains debated. To investigate the reliance of both solution types on cognitive resources, we assessed the involvement of the prefrontal cortex using vagally mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV) as an index. Participants (N = 68) solved 70 compound remote associates word puzzles solvable with insight and non-insight. Before, during, and after solving the word puzzles, we measured the vmHRV. Our results showed that resting-state vmHRV (trait) showed a negative association with behavioural performance for both solution types. This might reflect inter-individual differences in inhibitory control. As the solution search requires one to think of remote associations, inhibitory control might hamper rather than aid this process. Furthermore, we observed, for both solution types, a vmHRV increase from resting-state to solution search (state), lingering on in the post-task recovery period. This could mark the increase of prefrontal resources to promote an open-minded stance, essential for divergent thinking, which arguably is crucial for this task. Our findings suggest that, at a general level, both solution types share common aspects. However, a closer analysis of early and late solutions and puzzle difficulty suggested that metacognitive differentiation between insight and non-insight improved with higher trait vmHRV, and that a unique association between trait vmHRV and puzzle difficulty was present for each solution type.","container-title":"Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Insight and non-insight problem solving: A heart rate variability study","author":[{"family":"Stuyck","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Demeyer","given":"Febe"},{"family":"Bratanov","given":"Christo"},{"family":"Cleeremans","given":"Axel"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"citation-key":"stuyckInsightNoninsightProblem2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"stuyckInsightNoninsightProblem2024"},{"id":"oveisEmotionRegulationContagion2020","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The current research examined the interpersonal dynamics of emotion regulation in a stressful collaborative context.

We tested hypotheses arising from this claim using a dyadic experiment (N ϭ 266) that assessed in vivo physiological stress responses during collaborative work (a face-to-face product design task) and then individual work (a product pitch to evaluators). Throughout the experiment, the manipulated teammate was randomly assigned to reappraise their stress arousal, suppress their emotional displays, or receive no instructions. The nonmanipulated teammate received no instructions in all experimental conditions. Stress reappraisal benefited both teammates, eliciting challenge-like physiological responses (higher cardiac output, lower total peripheral resistance) relative to the suppression and control conditions. These effects were observed during both collaborative and individual work. A mediation model suggested that face-to-face interpersonal effects of stress reappraisal fed forward to promote nonmanipulated teammates’ improved stress responses during individual performance. Moreover, manipulated teammates’ displays of positive and negative affect emerged as potential mechanisms for improvements in nonmanipulated teammates’ stress responses in moderation analyses. Thus, participants benefited by interacting with a person who reappraised their stress as functional.

The results indicate a need to focus on the series of strategic actions activated in group interactions.

The study also shows that even though group-level regulation is more likely to change the valence of the group’s interaction from negative to positive, regulation does not always succeed in making a difference to the students’ overall emotional experiences.","container-title":"International Journal of Educational Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijer.2020.101589","ISSN":"08830355","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Educational Research","language":"en","page":"101589","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Socio-emotional interaction in collaborative learning: Combining individual emotional experiences and group-level emotion regulation","title-short":"Socio-emotional interaction in collaborative learning","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0883035520303785","volume":"102","author":[{"family":"Mänty","given":"Kristiina"},{"family":"Järvenoja","given":"Hanna"},{"family":"Törmänen","given":"Tiina"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"citation-key":"mantySocioemotionalInteractionCollaborative2020","library":"My Library","citekey":"mantySocioemotionalInteractionCollaborative2020"},{"id":"punRecognizingFilmAestheticsa","type":"article-journal","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Recognizing Film Aesthetics, Spectators’ Affect and Aesthetic Emotions from Multimodal Signals","author":[{"family":"Pun","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Chanel","given":"Dr Guillaume"}],"citation-key":"punRecognizingFilmAestheticsa","library":"My Library","citekey":"punRecognizingFilmAestheticsa"},{"id":"punRecognizingFilmAestheticsb","type":"article-journal","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Recognizing Film Aesthetics, Spectators’ Affect and Aesthetic Emotions from Multimodal Signals","author":[{"family":"Pun","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Chanel","given":"Dr Guillaume"}],"citation-key":"punRecognizingFilmAestheticsb","library":"My Library","citekey":"punRecognizingFilmAestheticsb"},{"id":"michalskyCharismaticPeopleProduce2020a","type":"paper-conference","abstract":"While early research on charismatic communication focused on charismatic language and more specifically rhetoric strategies, recent studies increasingly reveal the acoustic-prosodic features of charismatic speech.

We assessed the PASCAL charisma score as well as its individual acoustic features of 30 female speakers and correlated them with the Big Five personality traits. The results suggest that charismatic speech is not correlated with a charismatic personality, which supports the hypothesis that charismatic speech constitutes a skill that needs to be learned and is largely independent of personality. However, certain personality facets may facilitate speaker charisma and are correlated with acoustic features that make up charismatic speech. Specifically, assertiveness and activity correlate with a more charismatic f0 mean, articulation rate as well as phrase duration for female speakers, while facets such as anxiety, diligence and surprisingly gregariousness seem to be detrimental to speaker charisma.","container-title":"Speech Prosody 2020","DOI":"10.21437/SpeechProsody.2020-143","event-title":"Speech Prosody 2020","language":"en","page":"700-704","publisher":"ISCA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Do charismatic people produce charismatic speech?

This type of synchrony is critical for human relationships, as it promotes two important outcomes: the quality of the relationships between synchronized individuals, and how well syn­ chronized individuals perform together. Nonetheless a clear estimation of the size of the correlations between interpersonal physiological synchrony and relationship or performance outcomes is missing. To address this gap in knowledge was the main goal of the current meta-analysis. We focused on interpersonal physiological syn­ chrony in measures of autonomic nervous system activity, and specifically we examined the distinct branches of the autonomic nervous system. We conducted two meta-analyses: (1) Estimating the association between interpersonal physiological synchrony and relationship outcomes (2) Estimating the association between inter­ personal physiological synchrony and performance outcomes. In the first meta-analysis (i.e., relationships), the overall estimated correlation was small with a marginal significance (ES=0.09, p>.10) and high heterogeneity (I2=76.0%). In further sub-group analysis, we discovered a positive relationship for measures of sympathetic synchrony (ES=0.19, p=.02), a negative relationship for measures of parasympathetic synchrony(ES=-0.21, p=.03), and a positive relationship for measures of combined sympathetic and parasympathetic synchrony (ES =0.16, p=.02). As for the second meta-analysis (i.e., performance), the overall effect size of correlation was small (ES=0.26, p<.01) and heterogeneous (I2=52.7%). Our results emphasize the small effect sizes of the correlations between physiological synchrony and performance or relational outcomes, as well as the differential effects for synchrony in sympathetic versus parasympathetic activity. Combined with the high heterogeneity, our results point to the need for a rigorous a-priori scientific approach which distinguishes between different types of physiological synchrony.","container-title":"Physiology & Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.physbeh.2021.113391","ISSN":"00319384","journalAbbreviation":"Physiology & Behavior","language":"en","page":"113391","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Interpersonal autonomic nervous system synchrony and its association to relationship and performance – a systematic review and meta-analysis","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0031938421000834","volume":"235","author":[{"family":"Mayo","given":"Oded"},{"family":"Lavidor","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Ilanit"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6]]},"citation-key":"mayoInterpersonalAutonomicNervous2021","library":"My Library","citekey":"mayoInterpersonalAutonomicNervous2021"},{"id":"kaziTeamPhysiologicalDynamics2021a","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Objective: Review the use of physiological measurement in team settings and propose recommendations to improve the state of the science.\nBackground: New sensor and analytical capabilities enable exploration of relationships between team members’ physiological dynamics.

Our aim was to apply two metrics derived from different data streams to study how trigger events for SSRL shaped group linguistic alignment (based on audio data) and physiological synchrony (based on electrodermal activity data). The data came from six groups of students (N = 18) as they worked face-to-face on a collaborative learning task with one cognitive and two emotional trigger events. We found that the cognitive trigger event increased linguistic alignment in task-description words and led to physiological out-of-synchrony. The emotional trigger events decreased out-of-synchrony and increased high-arousal synchrony at the physiological level but did not affect linguistic alignment. Therefore, different metrics for studying markers and responses to different types of trigger events are needed, suggesting the necessity for multimodal learning analytics to support collaborative learning.","container-title":"Journal of Learning Analytics","DOI":"10.18608/jla.2024.8287","ISSN":"1929-7750","journalAbbreviation":"Learning Analytics","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0","page":"1-18","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Learners’ Linguistic Alignment and Physiological Synchrony: Identifying Trigger Events that Invite Socially Shared Regulation of Learning","title-short":"Learners’ Linguistic Alignment and Physiological Synchrony","URL":"https://learning-analytics.info/index.php/JLA/article/view/8287","author":[{"family":"Lämsä","given":"Joni"},{"family":"Edwards","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Haataja","given":"Eetu"},{"family":"Sobocinski","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Peña","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Andy"},{"family":"Järvelä","given":"Sanna"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,25]]},"citation-key":"lamsaLearnersLinguisticAlignment2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"lamsaLearnersLinguisticAlignment2024"},{"id":"mszynskiRecognizingFilmAesthetics2018","type":"manuscript","genre":"dissertation","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Recognizing Film Aesthetics, Spectators’ Affect and Aesthetic Emotions from Multimodal Signals","author":[{"family":"Mszynski","given":"Michal"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"citation-key":"mszynskiRecognizingFilmAesthetics2018","library":"My Library","citekey":"mszynskiRecognizingFilmAesthetics2018"},{"id":"graesserEmotionsLearningAutoTutor","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The relationship between emotions and learning was investigated by tracking the emotions that college students experienced while learning about computer literacy with AutoTutor.

Recently, it has been shown that synchronization is indicative of subjective ratings of group processes and task performance. However, different methods have been used to quantify synchronization, and ­little is known about the effects of the choice of method and level of analysis (individuals, dyads, or triads) on the results. In this study, participants performed a decision-m­ aking task in groups of three while physiological signals (heart rate and electrodermal ­activity), positive affective behavior, and personality traits were measured. First, we investigated the effects of different levels of analysis of physiological synchrony on affective behavior. We computed synchrony measures as (a) individual contributions to group synchrony, (b) the average dyadic synchrony within a group, and (c) group-­level synchrony. Second, we assessed the association between ­physiological ­synchrony and positive affective behavior. Third, we investigated the moderating effects of trait anxiety and social phobia on behavior. We discovered that the effects of physiological synchrony on positive affective behavior were particularly strong at the group level but nonsignificant at the individual and dyadic levels. Moreover, we found that heart rate and electrodermal synchronization showed ­opposite effects on group members' display of affective behavior. Finally, trait anxiety moderated the relationship between physiological synchrony and affective behavior, perhaps due to social uncertainty, while social phobia did not have a moderating effect. We discuss these results regarding the role of different physiological signals and task demands during joint action.","container-title":"Psychophysiology","DOI":"10.1111/psyp.13857","ISSN":"0048-5772, 1469-8986","issue":"9","journalAbbreviation":"Psychophysiology","language":"en","page":"e13857","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Group‐level physiological synchrony and individual‐level anxiety predict positive affective behaviors during a group decision‐making task","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.13857","volume":"58","author":[{"family":"Gordon","given":"Ilanit"},{"family":"Wallot","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Berson","given":"Yair"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9]]},"citation-key":"gordonGrouplevelPhysiologicalSynchrony2021","library":"My Library","citekey":"gordonGrouplevelPhysiologicalSynchrony2021"},{"id":"gollandStudyingDynamicsAutonomic2014a","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Recent theories emphasize the dynamic aspects of emotions.

These findings suggest ANS dysregulation may be involved in the pathogenesis of affective disorders. Different affective states are characterised by different ANS activity patterns (i.e., an increase or decrease in sympathetic or parasympathetic activity). To understand how ANS abnormalities are involved in the development of affective disorders, it is important to understand how affective states correlate with ANS activity before their onset. Using heart rate variability (HRV) as a tool to measure ANS activity, this review aimed to look at associations between affective states and HRV in non-clinical populations (i.e., in those without medical and psychiatric disorders). Searches on PubMed and Google Scholar were completed using the following search terms: heart rate variability, autonomic nervous system, sympathetic nervous system, para­ sympathetic nervous system, affective state, mood and emotion in all possible combinations. All but one of the studies examined (N = 13), demonstrated significant associations between affect and HRV. Findings suggest negative affect, encompassing both diffused longer-term experiences (i.e., mood) as well as more focused shortterm experiences (i.e., emotions), may be associated with a reduction in parasympathetic activity as measured through HRV parameters known to quantify parasympathetic activity (e.g., high frequency (HF)-HRV). HRV measures typically linked to reduction in parasympathetic activity appear to be linked to negative affective states in non-clinical populations. However, given the complex and possibly non-linear relationship between HRV and parasympathetic activity, further studies need to clarify specificity of these findings. Future studies should investigate the potential utility of HRV measures as biomarkers for monitoring changes in affective states and for early detection of onset and relapse of depression in patients with affective disorders.","container-title":"International Journal of Psychophysiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2023.08.001","ISSN":"01678760","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Psychophysiology","language":"en","page":"35-42","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Heart rate variability (HRV) as a way to understand associations between the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and affective states: A critical review of the literature","title-short":"Heart rate variability (HRV) as a way to understand associations between the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and affective states","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167876023004853","volume":"192","author":[{"family":"Gullett","given":"Nancy"},{"family":"Zajkowska","given":"Zuzanna"},{"family":"Walsh","given":"Annabel"},{"family":"Harper","given":"Ross"},{"family":"Mondelli","given":"Valeria"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10]]},"citation-key":"gullettHeartRateVariability2023a","library":"My Library","citekey":"gullettHeartRateVariability2023a"},{"id":"gruberHeartRateVariability2015b","type":"article-journal","abstract":"One promising avenue toward a better understanding of the pathophysiology of positive emotional disturbances is to examine high-frequency heart rate variability (HRV-HF), which has been implicated as a potential physiological index of disturbances in positive emotional functioning. To date, only a few psychopathology relevant studies have systematically quantiﬁed HRV-HF proﬁles using more ecologically valid methods in everyday life. Using an experience-sampling approach, the present study examined both mean levels and intra-individual variability of HRV-HF – as well as comparison measures of cardiovascular arousal, sympathetic activity, and gross somatic movement – in everyday life, using ambulatory psychophysiological measurement across a six-day consecutive period among a spectrum of community adult participants with varying degrees of positive valence system disturbance, including adults with bipolar I disorder (BD; n = 21), major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 17), and healthy non-psychiatric controls (CTL; n = 28). Groups did not differ in mean HRV-HF, but greater HRVHF instability (i.e., intra-individual variation in HRV-HF) was found in the BD compared to both MDD and CTL groups. Subsequent analyses suggested that group differences in HRV-HF variability were largely accounted for by variations in clinician-rated manic symptoms. However, no association was found between HRV-HF variability and dimensional measures of positive affectivity. This work provides evidence consistent with a quadratic relationship between HRV-HF and positive emotional disturbance and represents a valuable step toward developing a more ecologically valid model of positive valence system disturbances and their underlying psychophysiological mechanisms within an RDoC framework.","container-title":"International Journal of Psychophysiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2015.08.005","ISSN":"01678760","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Psychophysiology","language":"en","page":"240-248","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Heart rate variability as a potential indicator of positive valence system disturbance: A proof of concept investigation","title-short":"Heart rate variability as a potential indicator of positive valence system disturbance","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167876015300210","volume":"98","author":[{"family":"Gruber","given":"June"},{"family":"Mennin","given":"Douglas S."},{"family":"Fields","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Purcell","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Murray","given":"Greg"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11]]},"citation-key":"gruberHeartRateVariability2015b","library":"My Library","citekey":"gruberHeartRateVariability2015b"},{"id":"graesserEmotionsLearningAutoTutor2007","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The relationship between emotions and learning was investigated by tracking the emotions that college students experienced while learning about computer literacy with AutoTutor.

This is accompanied by physiological changes such as galvanic skin response (GSR), an indicator for emotional arousal, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), referring to vagal activity. We investigated whether the presence of a cinema audience affects these psychophysiological processes. The study was conducted in a real cinema in Berlin. Participants came twice to watch previously rated emotional film scenes eliciting amusement, anger, tenderness or fear. Once they watched the scenes alone, once in a group. We tested whether the vagal modulation in response to the mere presence of others influences explicit (reported) and implicit markers (RSA, heart rate (HR) and GSR) of emotional processes in function of solitary or collective enjoyment of movie scenes. On the physiological level, we found a mediating effect of vagal flexibility to the mere presence of others. Individuals showing a high baseline difference (alone vs. social) prior to the presentation of film, maintained higher RSA in the alone compared to the social condition. The opposite pattern emerged for low baseline difference individuals. Emotional arousal as reflected in GSR was significantly more pronounced during scenes eliciting anger independent of the social condition. On the behavioural level, we found evidence for emotion-specific effects on reported empathy, emotional intensity and Theory of Mind. Furthermore, people who decrease their RSA in response to others’ company are those who felt themselves more empathically engaged with the characters. Our data speaks in favour of a specific role of vagal regulation in response to the mere presence of others in terms of explicit empathic engagement with characters during shared filmic experience.","container-title":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0223259","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","journalAbbreviation":"PLoS ONE","language":"en","page":"e0223259","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sharing the filmic experience - The physiology of socio-emotional processes in the cinema","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0223259","volume":"14","author":[{"family":"Kaltwasser","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Rost","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Ardizzi","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Calbi","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Settembrino","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Fingerhut","given":"Joerg"},{"family":"Pauen","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Gallese","given":"Vittorio"}],"editor":[{"family":"Avenanti","given":"Alessio"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,19]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,18]]},"citation-key":"kaltwasserSharingFilmicExperience2019a","library":"My Library","citekey":"kaltwasserSharingFilmicExperience2019a"},{"id":"jarvenojaCollaborativeLearningDesign2020","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to introduce our current research design to study socially shared regulation processes in a science classroom where a collaborative learning design is implemented. The design is based on a self-regulated learning framework that provides opportunities and support for self-initiated regulation among individual learners and collaborative groups. It utilizes modern technology to structure and support regulated learning in the groups. The paper focuses on elaborating the research design, particularly from the perspective of motivation and emotion, by presenting the dual relationship between designing learning scenario that supports learners’ motivation and emotion regulation with technology and researching the multifaceted role of motivation and emotion as they occur in collaborative learning. To do this, the paper ﬁrst describes the entire collaborative learning design while paying attention to how technology can be utilized to support the awareness of motivation, emotion, and their regulation. Then, the focus shifts to considering the methodological principles and implementation of multimodal data gathered in relation to authentic collaborative learning tasks. A case example from a secondary school science classroom demonstrates possibilities for multimodal data use in analyzing motivation, emotion, and their regulation in collaborative learning. It also illustrates the dual role of the implemented technological 6Q support tool by showing how data collected from the students’ use of the tool can be utilized in scientiﬁc analysis. The paper concludes by providing a short discussion about the current advancements of emerging technology in motivation and emotion research in the learning sciences highlighting the signiﬁcance of sharing the theoretical premises of the research design as well as practical experiences from implementation of these designs for future research.","container-title":"Frontiers in Education","DOI":"10.3389/feduc.2020.00111","ISSN":"2504-284X","journalAbbreviation":"Front.

As agentic behaviour is based on psychological mechanisms, it is also reflected in a person’s inner, psychophysiological arousal. As agency is a relational process, physiological synchrony (mutual shifts in physiology) may provide unique insights into the role of agency in collaborative learning. This research uses two approaches to understand the continuous connection between physiological synchrony and agency behaviours. We use skin conductivity to measure physiological arousal both in reaction to context (phasic) and the level of intensity (tonic). As a novel parallel measure, we use coding of agency behaviours as a quantitative measurement to understand collaborative group work of four students during one lesson. Signal similarity analysis of a maximum time lag series (MTLC) by dynamic time warping (DTW) revealed moments of intense collaboration. The results indicate that students’ agency is reflected in physiological synchrony. During collaborative group work, the students displayed high physiological synchrony, with students’ tonic electrodermal activity (EDA) correlated with agency behaviours. The benefits of analysing skin conductivity and video analysis of agency behaviour together further the interpretation of physiological synchrony during social processes. Both physiological reactions and contemporary interpersonal analyses display a symbiotic relationship worthy of further investigation.","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.4711173","language":"en","source":"SSRN","title":"Physiological Synchrony in Interpersonal Agency: A Case Study on Collaborative Problem Solving of a Group of Year 7 Students","title-short":"Physiological Synchrony in Interpersonal Agency","URL":"https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=4711173","author":[{"family":"Salonen","given":"Reito  Visajaani"},{"family":"Haataja","given":"Eeva  Salme Helena"},{"family":"Sherwell","given":"Chase"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Man  Ching Esther"},{"family":"Cunnington","given":"Ross"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,19]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"citation-key":"salonenPhysiologicalSynchronyInterpersonal2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"salonenPhysiologicalSynchronyInterpersonal2024"},{"id":"rosenbergCharismaPerceptionText2009a","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Charisma, the ability to attract and retain followers without beneﬁt of formal authority, is more diﬃcult to deﬁne than to identify.

This paper describes the results of experiments designed to discover potential correlates of such judgments, in what speakers say and the way that they say it. We present results of two parallel experiments in which subjective judgments of charisma in spoken and in transcribed American political speech were analyzed with respect to the acoustic and prosodic (where applicable) and lexico-syntactic characteristics of the speech being assessed. While we ﬁnd that there is considerable disagreement among subjects on how the speakers of each token are ranked, we also ﬁnd that subjects appear to share a functional deﬁnition of charisma, in terms of other personal characteristics we asked them to rank speakers by. We also ﬁnd certain acoustic, prosodic, and lexico-syntactic characteristics that correlate signiﬁcantly with perceptions of charisma. Finally, by comparing the responses to spoken vs. transcribed stimuli, we attempt to distinguish between the contributions of ‘‘what is said” and ‘‘how it is said” with respect to charisma judgments.

However, there is still a dearth of research on developing CPS skills among elementary-school students. Our research therefore looks at how elementary school students’ regulation skills and emotions are supported by a collaborative game using a collaboration script to scaffold group awareness. An intervention was carried out with a sample of 223 students aged between 10 and 13. The experimental group worked collaboratively in sub-groups, scaffolded by the game, while the control group attended regular lessons. The students’ attitudes towards collaboration were evaluated before and after the intervention. In addition to this, a focus group was held a week after the intervention, which involved 32 students from both groups. The quantitative analysis revealed that attitudes towards collaboration improved significantly among students in the experimental group. This difference can be explained by a combination of the intervention, the students’ initial attitudes, and their respective GPAs. The qualitative analysis provided evidence of the regulation processes and emotions that emerge when combining a collaboration script with group awareness tools during CPS activities. Furthermore, the results highlighted the relationship between these tools and positive emotions (i.e., satisfaction), co-regulation, and shared regulation. These findings suggest that there is a relationship between the coregulation process required by the game and a shift in emotions from frustration to satisfaction. This work provides evidence of how scaffolding group awareness using a collaboration script supports regulation skills and emotions, thus promoting the development of Collaborative Problem-Solving skills.","container-title":"International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning","DOI":"10.1007/s11412-022-09362-0","ISSN":"1556-1607, 1556-1615","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Intern.

Speciﬁcally, it studies how students in a group monitor their cognitive, aﬀective and behavioral processes during their collaboration, as well as how observed monitoring cooccurs with their physiological synchrony during the collaborative learning session. Data was collected from 48 Finnish highschool students who were learning about nutrition in groups of three. The session was videotaped and coded in terms of monitoring of cognition, behavior and aﬀect. Students’ arousal was measured as electrodermal activity with wearable sensors and used to calculate physiological synchrony between the students. Three case groups, with priority on the quality of the data, were chosen for detailed analysis. The results indicate that the main targets of monitoring for these case groups were cognition and behavior, while monitoring of aﬀect occurred the least. Most of the student pairs inside the groups showed signiﬁcant amounts of physiological synchrony. High values of physiological synchrony occurred when monitoring was frequent. Time series analysis showed a weak positive connection between monitoring and physiological synchrony for two groups out of three. These results indicate that physiological synchrony could potentially shine a light on the joint regulation processes of collaborative learning groups.","container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2018.06.007","ISSN":"07475632","journalAbbreviation":"Computers in Human Behavior","language":"en","page":"337-347","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Monitoring in collaborative learning: Co-occurrence of observed behavior and physiological synchrony explored","title-short":"Monitoring in collaborative learning","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S074756321830284X","volume":"87","author":[{"family":"Haataja","given":"Eetu"},{"family":"Malmberg","given":"Jonna"},{"family":"Järvelä","given":"Sanna"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,24]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10]]},"citation-key":"haatajaMonitoringCollaborativeLearning2018","library":"My Library","citekey":"haatajaMonitoringCollaborativeLearning2018"},{"id":"mallickPursuitHappinessPower2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"As the world evolves, human-AI teams (HAT) have become increasingly more capable in their ability to complete task objectives.

Through 47 interviews, our ﬁndings show that for these AI teammates to be accepted, human teammates have preferences on understanding the emotional utility prior to its presentation, as well as which emotions are situationally acceptable. Also, ﬁndings show that integrating emotions within AI teammates has a positive inﬂuence on human perceptions and behaviour in a task. In further detail, emotions act as status updates that allow human teammates to not only better understand their teammates’ mental states but also understand how their AI teammates perceive the situation around them. Together, this gives insight into how AI emotional expressions inﬂuence the perception of social support on the wider Human-AI team. Mainly how emotions can be used to increase acceptance of AI teammates and improve the overall experience human teammates have within the task.","container-title":"Behaviour & Information Technology","DOI":"10.1080/0144929X.2023.2277909","ISSN":"0144-929X, 1362-3001","issue":"14","journalAbbreviation":"Behaviour & Information Technology","language":"en","page":"3436-3460","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The pursuit of happiness: the power and influence of AI teammate emotion in human-AI teamwork","title-short":"The pursuit of happiness","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0144929X.2023.2277909","volume":"43","author":[{"family":"Mallick","given":"Rohit"},{"family":"Flathmann","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Lancaster","given":"Caitlin"},{"family":"Hauptman","given":"Allyson"},{"family":"McNeese","given":"Nathan"},{"family":"Freeman","given":"Guo"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,24]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,25]]},"citation-key":"mallickPursuitHappinessPower2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"mallickPursuitHappinessPower2024"},{"id":"benedekContinuousMeasurePhasic2010","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Electrodermal activity is characterized by the superposition of what appear to be single distinct skin conductance responses (SCRs).

In an effort to facilitate more standardized scholarly approaches, this systematic review provides a description of existing work in the area and highlights theoretical, methodological, and statistical issues to be addressed in future interpersonal autonomic physiology research.","container-title":"Personality and Social Psychology Review","DOI":"10.1177/1088868316628405","ISSN":"1088-8683, 1532-7957","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"Pers Soc Psychol Rev","language":"en","page":"99-141","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Interpersonal Autonomic Physiology: A Systematic Review of the Literature","title-short":"Interpersonal Autonomic Physiology","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1088868316628405","volume":"21","author":[{"family":"Palumbo","given":"Richard V."},{"family":"Marraccini","given":"Marisa E."},{"family":"Weyandt","given":"Lisa L."},{"family":"Wilder-Smith","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"McGee","given":"Heather A."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Siwei"},{"family":"Goodwin","given":"Matthew S."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,24]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5]]},"citation-key":"palumboInterpersonalAutonomicPhysiology2017","library":"My Library","citekey":"palumboInterpersonalAutonomicPhysiology2017"},{"id":"reddySynergeyezingDecodingNonlinear2023a","type":"paper-conference","abstract":"Joint Visual Attention (JVA) has long been considered a critical component of successful collaborations, enabling coordination and construction of a shared knowledge space.

Specifcally, we analyze gaze data from 19 dyadic and triadic teams engaged in a co-located programming task using Recurrence Quantifcation Analysis (RQA). Our results emphasize the signifcance of team-level gaze regularity for improving task performance - highlighting the importance of maintaining stable or sustained episodes of joint or individual attention, than disjointed patterns. Additionally, through regression analyses, we examine the predictive capacity of recurrence metrics for subjective traits such as social cohesion and social loafng, revealing unique interpersonal and team dynamics behind productive collaborations.

Furthermore, it is challenging to un­ derstand the level of sharedness or togetherness among the team members when they go through a specific CPS phase. Consequently, this study aimed to investigate shared physiological arousal events (SPAE) in CPS. We developed and implemented a new method for detecting SPAEs during CPS by utilizing skin conductance response data. Our findings showed that SPAE can be a promising method for detecting the cognitive and socioemotional CPS phases that are demonstrated as increasing physiological arousal among the team members. Process-mining analysis of the SPAEs revealed different sequential pathways among the successful and less successful teams both in terms of the CPS phases and the problem variables they address during SPAEs.

Through interviews with 60 participants who collaborated with an AI teammate in a multiplayer online game, in this paper, we explore communication strategies that humans expect AI teammates to apply to support human-AI coordination and collaboration in dyadic teaming environments, and how the AI teammate's communication can impact teaming processes. Our findings highlight four communication strategies AI teammates should apply to support their coordination with humans in dyadic teaming environments. We also find that AI teammates' proactive communication with humans could facilitate the development of human trust and situation awareness, whereas AI lacking such proactive communication is often not perceived as a teammate.

We suggest that this real-time response represents a fundamental team cognitive skill regarding the rapidity and appropriateness of the response, and methods and metrics are needed to track this skill.\nMethod: Communication data from medical teams (Study 1) and submarine crews (Study 2) were analyzed for significant communication reorganization in response to training events. Mutual information between team members informed post hoc filtering to identify which team members contributed to reorganization.\nResults: Significant communication reorganizations corresponding to challenging training events were detected for all teams. Less experienced teams tended to show delayed and sometimes ineffective responses that more experienced teams did not. Mutual information and post hoc filtering identified the individual-level inputs driving reorganization and potential mechanisms (e.g., leadership emergence, role restructuring) underlying reorganization.\nConclusion: The ability of teams to rapidly and effectively reorganize coordination patterns as the situation demands is a team cognitive skill that can be measured and tracked.","container-title":"Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society","DOI":"10.1177/0018720819852791","ISSN":"0018-7208, 1547-8181","issue":"5","journalAbbreviation":"Hum Factors","language":"en","page":"825-860","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Measuring Real-Time Team Cognition During Team Training","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0018720819852791","volume":"62","author":[{"family":"Gorman","given":"Jamie C."},{"family":"Grimm","given":"David A."},{"family":"Stevens","given":"Ronald H."},{"family":"Galloway","given":"Trysha"},{"family":"Willemsen-Dunlap","given":"Ann M."},{"family":"Halpin","given":"Donald J."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,24]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8]]},"citation-key":"gormanMeasuringRealTimeTeam2020","library":"My Library","citekey":"gormanMeasuringRealTimeTeam2020"},{"id":"gormanTeamCoordinationDynamicsa","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Team coordination consists of both the dynamics of team member interaction and the environmental dynamics to which a team is subjected.

Nonlinear dynamic methods revealed differences that a traditional approach did not: Intact and Mixed team coordination dynamics looked very different; Mixed teams were more stable than Intact teams and explored the space of solutions without the need for correction. Stability was positively correlated with the number of roadblock perturbations that were overcome successfully. The novel and non-intuitive contribution of a dynamical analysis was that Mixed teams, who did not have a long history working together, were more adaptive.

A signiﬁcant aspect of our approach is the focus on the individual learner as the basic unit of analysis, in particular the quantiﬁcation of predispositions and capabilities that the individual learner brings to the learning environment. Such predispositions constitute the learner’s behavioral repertoire, captured here theoretically as a dynamical landscape (“intrinsic dynamics”). The learning process is demonstrated to not only lead to a relatively permanent improvement of performance in the required task—the usual outcome—but also to alter the individual’s entire repertoire. Changes in the dynamical landscape due to learning are shown to result from two basic mechanisms or “routes”: bifurcation and shift. Which mechanism is selected depends the initial individual repertoire before new learning begins. Both bifurcation and shift mechanisms are accommodated by a dynamical model, a relatively straightforward development of the well-established HKB model of movement coordination. Model simulations show that although environmental or task demands may be met equally well using either mechanism, the bifurcation route results in greater stabilization of the to-be-learned behavior. Thus, stability not (or not only) error is demonstrated to be the basis of selection, both of a new pattern of behavior and the path (smooth shift versus abrupt qualitative change) that learning takes. In line with these results, recent neurophysiological evidence indicates that stability is a relevant feature around which brain activity is organized while an individual performs a coordination task. Finally, we explore the consequences of the dynamical approach to learning for theories of biological change.","container-title":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","DOI":"10.3389/fnhum.2012.00222","ISSN":"1662-5161","journalAbbreviation":"Front.

Ten right-handed adults were required to reproduce eight series of 84 ellipses on a graphic tablet at spontaneous speed. The ellipses displayed seven eccentricities, corresponding to the Lissajous plot produced by two orthogonal harmonic oscillators whose relative phase (RP) varied from 0° (a line) to 90° (a circle), and twelve orientations, the long axis of the ellipses aligned in a direction ranging from three to nine o’clock with respect to the body transverse plane. Results conﬁrmed the participant’s preference for two eccentricities, 0° and 45°, that is, a line and an ellipse of intermediate eccentricity, respectively. Except for the circle, insensitive to orientation by definition, orientation became a cogent constraint: In the 10:30 o’clock direction, line drawing (0° RP) increased in variability and the intermediate ellipse (45° RP) was attracted towards a circle (90° RP). These ﬁndings suggest an interaction between orientation effects, putatively due to differences in the motion of the wrist and ﬁngers, and eccentricity effects, which may pertain to preferences arising from the non-linear coupling between the effectors.","container-title":"Human Movement Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.humov.2010.08.019","ISSN":"01679457","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"Human Movement Science","language":"en","license":"https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","page":"698-710","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Coordination dynamics of elliptic shape drawing: Effects of orientation and eccentricity","title-short":"Coordination dynamics of elliptic shape drawing","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167945710001764","volume":"30","author":[{"family":"Danna","given":"Jérémy"},{"family":"Athènes","given":"Sylvie"},{"family":"Zanone","given":"Pier-Giorgio"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,3]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",8]]},"citation-key":"dannaCoordinationDynamicsElliptic2011","library":"My Library","citekey":"dannaCoordinationDynamicsElliptic2011"},{"id":"mcgrathReducedAsymmetryMotor2016","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Hemispheric specialization for motor control inﬂuences how individuals perform and adapt to goal-directed movements. In contrast to adaptation, motor skill learning involves a process wherein one learns to synthesize novel movement capabilities in absence of perturbation such that they are performed with greater accuracy, consistency and efﬁciency. Here, we investigated manual asymmetry in acquisition and retention of a complex motor skill that requires speed and accuracy for optimal performance in right-handed and lefthanded individuals. We further determined if degree of handedness inﬂuences motor skill learning. Ten right-handed (RH) and 10 left-handed (LH) adults practiced two distinct motor skills with their dominant or nondominant arms during separate sessions two–four weeks apart. Learning was quantiﬁed by changes in the speed–accuracy tradeoff function measured at baseline and one-day retention. Manual asymmetry was evident in the RH group but not the LH group. RH group demonstrated signiﬁcantly greater skill improvement for their dominant-right hand than their nondominant-left hand. In contrast, for the LH group, both dominant and nondominant hands demonstrated comparable learning. Less strongly-LH individuals (lower EHI scores) exhibited more learning of their dominant hand. These results suggest that while hemispheric specialization inﬂuences motor skill learning, these effects may be inﬂuenced by handedness.","container-title":"Human Movement Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.humov.2015.11.012","ISSN":"01679457","journalAbbreviation":"Human Movement Science","language":"en","page":"130-141","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Reduced asymmetry in motor skill learning in left-handed compared to right-handed individuals","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167945715300622","volume":"45","author":[{"family":"McGrath","given":"Robert L."},{"family":"Kantak","given":"Shailesh S."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,3]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2]]},"citation-key":"mcgrathReducedAsymmetryMotor2016","library":"My Library","citekey":"mcgrathReducedAsymmetryMotor2016"},{"id":"mitraIntermediateMotorLearning1998","type":"article-journal","abstract":"A classical view is that motor learning has distinguishable early, intermediate, and late phases. A recent view is that motor learning is the acquisition of an abstract equation of motion that specifies the time evolution of a pattern of coordination. The pattern is expressed by a collective variable that enslaves or orders component subsystems that, in turn, act on and generate the collective variable. In these latter terms, early learning resolves the collective variable and its motion equation, intermediate learning stabilizes and standardizes the subsystems or active degrees of freedom (DFs) producing the collective variable’s dynamics. The preceding ideas, and the phase-space reconstruction methods required to determine active DFs, are developed in tutorial fashion in the context of an experimental investigation of learning a bimanual rhythmic coordination. Results show that intermediate learning reduces the dimensionality of the learned coordination’s dynamics and renders those dynamics more deterministic.

From the work on cats it is known that the rhythmic muscle activities during gait are generated by specialized neural circuits located in the spinal cord (the so-called central pattern generator, \"CPGs\"). These CPGs are coordinated by neurons, which interconnect both sides or which transmit information between the cervical and lumbar spine. It is argued that afferent input, especially load-related information, plays a major role in shaping the resulting coordination of these CPGs. Induced changes are seen not only with a general loading of the animal but also with the selective loading of a given limb. Such principles also apply to human locomotion. Studies on infants have shown that basic coordination patterns exist, very similar to those found in the cat. The effects of afferents (notably those related to load and to hip position) play an important role in phase transitions, much as was described in feline la models. In adults, the role of proprioceptive afferents was studied by muscle vibration (selective stimulus for afferents) and by adding load (activating mainly Ib afferents). When applied during gait, tendon vibration has little effect on intra - and interlimb coordination. In contrast, load manipulations produce more profound changes. During gait, the loading of one of the limbs induces adaptations in inter-limb coordination in the 3 remaining limbs, thereby providing rhythm constancy (stable cadence). This is in line with other evidence indicating that the coordination between arm and leg movements is quite robust across various types of locomotion, suggesting a strong coupling between both homologous and non-homologous limbs.","container-title":"Neuro-Behavioral Determinants of Interlimb Coordination","event-place":"Boston, MA","ISBN":"978-1-4613-4777-4","language":"en","note":"DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4419-9056-3_1","page":"3-33","publisher":"Springer US","publisher-place":"Boston, MA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sensory Influences on Interlimb Coordination During Gait","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4419-9056-3_1","editor":[{"family":"Swinnen","given":"Stephan P."},{"family":"Duysens","given":"Jacques"}],"author":[{"family":"Duysens","given":"Jacques"},{"family":"Donker","given":"Stella"},{"family":"Verschueren","given":"Sabine M.
