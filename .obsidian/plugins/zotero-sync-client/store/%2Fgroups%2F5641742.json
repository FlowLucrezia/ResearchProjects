      "abstractNote": "Most human actions are composed of two fundamental movement types, discrete and rhythmic movements. These movement types, or primitives, are analogous to the two elemental behaviors of nonlinear dynamical systems, namely, fixed-point and limit cycle behavior, respectively. Furthermore, there is now a growing body of research demonstrating how various human actions and behaviors can be effectively modeled and understood using a small set of low-dimensional, fixed-point and limit cycle dynamical systems (differential equations). Here, we provide an overview of these dynamical motorprimitives and detail recent research demonstrating how these dynamical primitives can be used to model the task dynamics of complex multiagent behavior. More specifically, we review how a task-dynamic model of multiagent shepherding behavior, composed of rudimentary fixed-point and limit cycle dynamical primitives, can not only effectively model the behavior of cooperating human co-actors, but also reveals how the discovery and intentional use of optimal behavioral coordination during task learning is marked by a spontaneous, self-organized transition between fixed-point and limit cycle dynamics (i.e., via a Hopf bifurcation).",

I frame this review around seven principles in dynamical systems: three that are well-represented in interpersonal coordination research to date (emergent behavior, context-sensitive behavior, and attractors) and four that could be useful opportunities for future growth (hysteresis, sensitivity to initial conditions, equifinality, and reciprocal compensation). In addition to identifying specific promising lines of theoretical inquiry, I focus on the significant potential afforded by computationally intensive science—especially in naturally occurring data or trace data. Building on the foundation laid over the past three decades, I argue that looking to increasingly situated and naturalistic settings (and data) is not only necessary to realize the full commitment to the dynamical hypothesis but is also critical to building parsimonious and principled theories of social phenomena.",

      "abstractNote": "This article concentrates on the question what kind of model - conceptual and statistical - can serve as a good working model for the study of learning and teaching processes qua processes. We claim that a good way of answering this question is to begin by observing a teaching and learning process as, where, and when it occurs. In addition, a conceptual model of intertwined learning-teaching processes is discussed, and dynamic modeling as an approach to theory formation about teaching-learning processes. The focus lies on the evolution term, the timescale of interaction processes, state space as a perspective on teacher-student interaction dynamics, and the principle of agency. Finally, an empirical approach to studying teaching-learning processes is illustrated by means of a case study, focusing on the use of cluster analyses techniques. In the Conclusion and Discussion section, further perspectives on theory building and empirical research are discussed.",

We used Motion Energy Analysis to examine Social Motor Synchrony (SMS) in familiar partners of the same neurotype: pairs of autistic and of neurotypical children. Partners played two shared tablet activities, one to support collaboration by facilitating engagement and other-awareness (Connect), and one with no additional design features to facilitate collaboration (Colours). The neurotypical group showed similar SMS to the autistic group in Colours but lower SMS in Connect. The autistic group displayed similar levels of SMS in each activity. Autistic children can synchronise to a similar, or greater, degree than neurotypical children when the social context and type of task are considered.",

In response to Tickle-Degnen’s call for a more theoretically complete analysis of the rapport construct, we empirically evaluated her adaptation of Csíkszentmihályi’s optimal experience model with the hope of better conceptualizing rapport’s behavioral manifestations. Dyads (N = 50) engaged in two interdependent tasks and completed a battery of post-task measures gauging their mood dyad and experiences of rapport. To complement self-report measures, we coded rapport-based behavior using both subjective (thin-slice judgments) and objective (Motion Energy Analysis) methodologies. According to Tickle-Degnen’s model, dyadic exchanges with moderate levels of expressivity and interpersonal coordination should yield the highest levels of rapport. Although data from our objective coding did not trend in this manner, subjective measurements of coordinated expressivity matched the paradigm’s prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first study to empirically support Tickle-Degnen’s hypothesis and a novel step toward clarifying the rapport construct.",

      "abstractNote": "Objective In social interactions, humans tend to naturally synchronize their body movements. We investigated interpersonal synchronization in conversations and examined its relationship with personality differences and post-interaction appraisals. Method In a 15-minute semi-structured conversation, 56 previously-unfamiliar dyads introduced themselves, followed by self-disclosing and argumentative conversations. Their bodily movements were video-recorded in a standardized room (112 young adults, aged 18–33, mean = 20.54, SD = 2.74; 58% Dutch, 31% German, 11% other). Interpersonal bodily synchronization was estimated as (a) synchronization strength using Windowed Lagged Cross-Correlations and (b) Dynamic Organization (Determinism/Entropy/Laminarity/Mean Line) using Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis. Bodily synchronization was associated with differences in Agreeableness and Extraversion (IPIP-NEO-120) and post-conversational appraisals (affect/closeness/enjoyment) in mixed-effect models. Results Agreeable participants exhibited higher complexity in bodily synchronization dynamics (higher Entropy) than disagreeable individuals, who also reported more negative affect afterward. Interpersonal synchronization was stronger among extroverts than among introverts and extroverts appraised conversations as more positive and enjoyable. Bodily synchronization strength and dynamic organization were related to the type of conversation (self-disclosing/argumentative). Conclusions Interpersonal dynamics were intimately connected to differences in Agreeableness and Extraversion, varied across situations, and these parameters affected how pleasant, close, and enjoyable each conversation felt.",

In Study I, charismatic leaders were college students whose performance of a simulated campaign speech included more smiles, more intense smiles, and longer and more frequent visual attention to the audience. Observers showed higher levels of all 4 relevant behaviors while watching charismatic leaders. In Study 2, college student participants watched more and less charismatic excerpts selected from President Clinton's and ex‐President Bush's responses during their first 1992 televised debate. Comparing the same behaviors, there was a similar pattern to Study I for responses to the Clinton excerpts, and an almost reversed pattern for the Bush excerpts. The overall results support an emotional contagion effect of charismatic leadership when the leader exhibits truly charismatic behavior.",

      "abstractNote": "In a series of studies, we examine the role of positive emotions in the charismatic leadership process. In Studies 1 and 2, ratings of charisma in a natural work setting were linked to leaders' positive emotional expressions. In Study 3, leaders' positive emotional expressions were linked to mood states of simulated followers. Results suggest that mood contagion may be one of the psychological mechanisms by which charismatic leaders influence followers. In Study 4, we used a trained actor and manipulated leaders' positive emotional expressions to isolate the effects of positive emotions from the potential effects of non-emotional aspects of effective leadership (e.g., vision, other inspirational influence processes). A positive link between leader emotions and follower mood was found. Results also indicate that both leaders' positive emotional expressions and follower mood influenced ratings of leader effectiveness and attraction to the leader.",

      "abstractNote": "Two studies were conducted to test the hypothesis that charismatic leadership, characterized by nonverbal expressiveness and immediacy, would lead via emotional contagion to the imitation of the leader's nonverbal behavior. In Study I, charismatic leaders were college students whose performance of a simulated campaign speech included more smiles, more intense smiles, and longer and more frequent visual attention to the audience. Observers showed higher levels of all 4 relevant behaviors while watching charismatic leaders. In Study 2, college student participants watched more and less charismatic excerpts selected from President Clinton's and ex‐President Bush's responses during their first 1992 televised debate. Comparing the same behaviors, there was a similar pattern to Study I for responses to the Clinton excerpts, and an almost reversed pattern for the Bush excerpts. The overall results support an emotional contagion effect of charismatic leadership when the leader exhibits truly charismatic behavior.",

High-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), a marker of vagally-mediated parasympathetic activity, has been conceptualized as a psychophysiological index of emotion regulation that may moderate individuals’ responses to stress. Using a daily diary design, we tested whether individual differ­ ences in resting HF-HRV moderated the association between daily child-related stress and negative affect among a sample of 84 heterosexual couples with preschool-aged children. After controlling for participants’ age, gender, socioeconomic status, employment status, and ethnicity, hierarchical linear modeling revealed that resting HFHRV moderated both the between-person and within-person associations between self-reported child-related stress and daily negative affect. Between-person analyses indicated that the strength of the positive association between mean daily child stress and negative affect across the daily diary period increased with decreasing resting HF-HRV. Similarly, within-person analyses indicated that on days when participants reported more childrelated stress than usual, the magnitude of the increase in negative affect on that day was inversely related to resting HF-HRV. Taken together, these findings suggest that lower resting HF-HRV may index vulnerability to stress-related disturbances in negative affect. This increased negative affective response to daily stress may be one pathway through which individuals with lower resting HF-HRV are at increased risk for depressive symp­ toms over time.",

      "abstractNote": "Stress exposure increases risk for depressive symptoms. However, there are substantial individual differences in affective responses to stress. High-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), a marker of vagally-mediated parasympathetic activity, has been conceptualized as a psychophysiological index of emotion regulation that may moderate individuals’ responses to stress. Using a daily diary design, we tested whether individual differ­ ences in resting HF-HRV moderated the association between daily child-related stress and negative affect among a sample of 84 heterosexual couples with preschool-aged children. After controlling for participants’ age, gender, socioeconomic status, employment status, and ethnicity, hierarchical linear modeling revealed that resting HFHRV moderated both the between-person and within-person associations between self-reported child-related stress and daily negative affect. Between-person analyses indicated that the strength of the positive association between mean daily child stress and negative affect across the daily diary period increased with decreasing resting HF-HRV. Similarly, within-person analyses indicated that on days when participants reported more childrelated stress than usual, the magnitude of the increase in negative affect on that day was inversely related to resting HF-HRV. Taken together, these findings suggest that lower resting HF-HRV may index vulnerability to stress-related disturbances in negative affect. This increased negative affective response to daily stress may be one pathway through which individuals with lower resting HF-HRV are at increased risk for depressive symp­ toms over time.",

To date, only a few psychopathology relevant studies have systematically quantiﬁed HRV-HF proﬁles using more ecologically valid methods in everyday life. Using an experience-sampling approach, the present study examined both mean levels and intra-individual variability of HRV-HF – as well as comparison measures of cardiovascular arousal, sympathetic activity, and gross somatic movement – in everyday life, using ambulatory psychophysiological measurement across a six-day consecutive period among a spectrum of community adult participants with varying degrees of positive valence system disturbance, including adults with bipolar I disorder (BD; n = 21), major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 17), and healthy non-psychiatric controls (CTL; n = 28). Groups did not differ in mean HRV-HF, but greater HRVHF instability (i.e., intra-individual variation in HRV-HF) was found in the BD compared to both MDD and CTL groups. Subsequent analyses suggested that group differences in HRV-HF variability were largely accounted for by variations in clinician-rated manic symptoms. However, no association was found between HRV-HF variability and dimensional measures of positive affectivity. This work provides evidence consistent with a quadratic relationship between HRV-HF and positive emotional disturbance and represents a valuable step toward developing a more ecologically valid model of positive valence system disturbances and their underlying psychophysiological mechanisms within an RDoC framework.",

These findings suggest ANS dysregulation may be involved in the pathogenesis of affective disorders. Different affective states are characterised by different ANS activity patterns (i.e., an increase or decrease in sympathetic or parasympathetic activity). To understand how ANS abnormalities are involved in the development of affective disorders, it is important to understand how affective states correlate with ANS activity before their onset. Using heart rate variability (HRV) as a tool to measure ANS activity, this review aimed to look at associations between affective states and HRV in non-clinical populations (i.e., in those without medical and psychiatric disorders). Searches on PubMed and Google Scholar were completed using the following search terms: heart rate variability, autonomic nervous system, sympathetic nervous system, para­ sympathetic nervous system, affective state, mood and emotion in all possible combinations. All but one of the studies examined (N = 13), demonstrated significant associations between affect and HRV. Findings suggest negative affect, encompassing both diffused longer-term experiences (i.e., mood) as well as more focused shortterm experiences (i.e., emotions), may be associated with a reduction in parasympathetic activity as measured through HRV parameters known to quantify parasympathetic activity (e.g., high frequency (HF)-HRV). HRV measures typically linked to reduction in parasympathetic activity appear to be linked to negative affective states in non-clinical populations. However, given the complex and possibly non-linear relationship between HRV and parasympathetic activity, further studies need to clarify specificity of these findings. Future studies should investigate the potential utility of HRV measures as biomarkers for monitoring changes in affective states and for early detection of onset and relapse of depression in patients with affective disorders.",

      "abstractNote": "This study examined dynamic attractor states in skin conductance activity during resting baselines and media viewing in order to determine if there are qualitatively distinct dynamics during information processing and whether those dynamics vary based on features of task stimuli. The results indicate that media viewing shifts one from a resting nonchaotic attractor to a chaotic attractor. Content valence (positive or negative) and the emotional context in which videos were delivered (presentation order) had significant impact on the probability of exhibiting a chaotic attractor. Using the nonlinear dynamic systems approach, this study provides novel understandings of emotional information processing, the electrodermal system, and the relationship between physiological and emotional experiences.",

      "abstractNote": "This article seeks to demonstrate that implicit within Weber’s writings on charisma are tools that can enable a processual, social constructionist understanding of charismatic formation. A corollary of this point is that Weber’s writings represent an historically crucial turning point in the progression from a Carlylian idea of leaders as inherently powerful to a non-essentialist, sociological perspective, and that Weber’s inspiration for this progression is best understood not through reference to his nineteenth-century forbearers in the social sciences, but rather in his contrast with the very few theological writers (namely Rudolph Sohm and the writers of the New Testament) who actually had employed charisma as a term prior to Weber’s famous appropriation of it. A reinterpretation and retranslation of Weber’s writings on charisma that gives priority to the social constructionist elements in his thought can provide tools for navigating through many of the interpretational controversies that have plagued charisma research.",

We investigated whether the presence of a cinema audience affects these psychophysiological processes. The study was conducted in a real cinema in Berlin. Participants came twice to watch previously rated emotional film scenes eliciting amusement, anger, tenderness or fear. Once they watched the scenes alone, once in a group. We tested whether the vagal modulation in response to the mere presence of others influences explicit (reported) and implicit markers (RSA, heart rate (HR) and GSR) of emotional processes in function of solitary or collective enjoyment of movie scenes. On the physiological level, we found a mediating effect of vagal flexibility to the mere presence of others. Individuals showing a high baseline difference (alone vs. social) prior to the presentation of film, maintained higher RSA in the alone compared to the social condition. The opposite pattern emerged for low baseline difference individuals. Emotional arousal as reflected in GSR was significantly more pronounced during scenes eliciting anger independent of the social condition. On the behavioural level, we found evidence for emotion-specific effects on reported empathy, emotional intensity and Theory of Mind. Furthermore, people who decrease their RSA in response to others’ company are those who felt themselves more empathically engaged with the characters. Our data speaks in favour of a specific role of vagal regulation in response to the mere presence of others in terms of explicit empathic engagement with characters during shared filmic experience.",

Does this social capital affect team performance because subordinates come to see the leader as charismatic? We answered this question by examining 2 models. First, we tested the charisma-to-centrality model according to which the leader’s charisma facilitates the occupation of a central position in the informal advice network. From this central position, the leader positively influences team performance. Second, we examined the centrality-to-charisma model according to which charisma is attributed to those leaders who are socially active in terms of giving and receiving advice. Attributed charisma facilitates increased team performance. We tested these 2 models in 2 different studies. In the first study, based on time-separated, multisource data emanating from members of 56 work teams, we found support for the centrality-to-charisma model. Formal leaders who were central within team advice networks were seen as charismatic by subordinates, and this charisma was associated with high team performance. To clarify how leader network centrality affected the emergence of charismatic leadership, we designed Study 2 in which, for 79 student teams, we measured leader networking activity and leader charisma at 2 different points in time and related these variables to team performance measured at a third point in time. On the basis of this temporally separated data set, we again found support for the centrality-to-charisma model.",

This article explores what collaborators understand about each other’s emotions and the potential beneﬁts for performance that might come from raising this understanding. In Experiment 1 co-located collaborators judged each other’s emotions after playing a game that required cooperative data collection and analysis. Their judgements were largely inaccurate and based on their own emotions, suggesting limited emotion understanding. Experiment 2 explored if this could be overcome by making collaborators aware of each other’s emotions. Co-located and remote collaborators played a cooperative puzzle-solving game under conditions of awareness or no awareness. Awareness was manipulated by making collaborators share their self-reported emotions during key moments of their game play. Both remote and co-located collaborators improved their performance after sharing their emotions. However, unlike co-located collaborators, remote collaborators also improved their understanding of each other’s emotions and experienced more positive affect. We conclude by discussing the content of collaborators’ emotion understanding and the probable mechanisms underlying the observed effects of being made aware of a partner’s emotions.",

      "abstractNote": "This study advanced knowledge on charisma by (a) introducing a new personality-based model to conceptualize and assess charisma and by (b) investigating curvilinear relationships between charismatic personality and leader effectiveness. Moreover, we delved deeper into this curvilinear association by (c) examining moderation by the leader’s level of adjustment and by (d) testing a process model through which the effects of charismatic personality on effectiveness are explained with a consideration of specific leader behaviors. Study 1 validated HDS charisma (Hogan Development Survey) as a useful trait-based measure of charisma. In Study 2 a sample of leaders (N ϭ 306) were assessed in the context of a 360-degree development center. In line with the too-much-of-a-good-thing effect, an inverted U-shaped relationship between charismatic personality and observer-rated leader effectiveness was found, indicating that moderate levels are better than low or high levels of charisma. Study 3 (N ϭ 287) replicated this curvilinear relationship and further illustrated the moderating role of leader adjustment, in such a way that the inflection point after which the effects of charisma turn negative occurs at higher levels of charisma when adjustment is high. Nonlinear mediation modeling further confirmed that strategic and operational leader behaviors fully mediate the curvilinear relationship. Leaders low on charisma are less effective because they lack strategic behavior; highly charismatic leaders are less effective because they lack operational behavior. In sum, this work provides insight into the dispositional nature of charisma and uncovers the processes through which and conditions under which leader charisma translates into (in)effectiveness.",

      "abstractNote": "Under the increasing inﬂuence of trait-perspectives on leadership, the current study introduces a personality-based measure of charisma. In order to obtain a Five-Factor Model (FFM) prototype for the charismatic leader, experts in the ﬁeld of leadership and personality research were invited to participate in an expert panel. For each of the 30 NEO PI-R facets, experts (N = 38) rated the prototypic case of a successful charismatic leader on a scale ranging between 1 (extremely low) and 9 (extremely high). Based on the FFM count technique (Miller, Bagby, Pilkonis, Reynolds, & Lynam, 2005), an easy-to-use count was developed in which facets that were rated as being prototypically high (≥7) or low (≤3) were summed together to calculate the FFM charisma score. To investigate the predictive validity of the FFM charisma count in terms of work-related outcomes, the 1994 Ghent alumni sample was used in which college alumni (N = 262) were administered the NEO PI-R before entering the labor market and 15 years later when their professional careers had unfolded. The results demonstrate that FFM charisma was positively related to extrinsic career outcomes 15 years later, including income, number of subordinates, and managerial level. Moreover, FFM charisma was positively associated with adaptive performance, and with career roles that directly relate to charismatic leadership. It is concluded that the FFM charisma compound provides opportunities to map charismatic tendencies in a career-relevant way.",

      "abstractNote": "In recent years, many agent-based models of human groups have implemented a mechanism of emotion contagion, yet empirical validation is lagging behind. The aim of the present paper is to validate an agent-based model of emotion contagion at the level of group emotion, by comparing simulations against the emotional development of real people in small groups. To study the effect of emotion contagion, the participants interacted via a video call, where they were virtually placed in different social environments while they played a quiz. This allowed the exchange of emotion among all, some or none of the participants. The patterns of emotional development in the empirical results supported our hypotheses based on literature of emotion contagion and social norms. Further, the simulations with the complete model resembled many of these patterns. When emotion contagion was disabled in the model, the resemblance decreased. These results give a ﬁrst indication that emotion contagion occurs in groups that meet via video calls, and can in-part be predicted by the proposed model of emotion contagion. Yet, further study with a larger and more diverse empirical sample is needed, as well as comparisons across contagion mechanisms, to draw stronger conclusions and ultimately justify societal application.",

      "abstractNote": "A key emergent property of group social dynamic is synchrony–the coordination of actions, emotions, or physiological processes between group members. Despite this fact and the inherent nested structure of groups, little research has assessed physiological synchronization between group members from a multi-level perspective, thus limiting a full understanding of the dynamics between members. To address this gap of knowledge we re-analyzed a large dataset (N = 261) comprising physiological and psychological data that were collected in two laboratory studies that involved two different social group tasks. In both studies, following the group task, members reported their experience of group cohesion via questionnaires. We utilized a nonlinear analysis method-multidimensional recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis that allowed us to represent physiological synchronization in cardiological interbeat intervals between group members at the individual-level and at the group-level. We found that across studies and their conditions, the change in physiological synchrony from baseline to group interaction predicted a psychological sense of group cohesion. This result was evident both at the individual and the group levels and was not modiﬁed by the context of the interaction. The individual- and group-level effects were highly correlated. These results indicate that the relationship between synchrony and cohesion is a multilayered construct. We re-afﬁrm the role of physiological synchrony for cohesion in groups. Future studies are needed to crystallize our understanding of the differences and similarities between synchrony at the individual-level and synchrony at the group level to illuminate under which conditions one of these levels has primacy, or how they interact.",

      "abstractNote": "Empathy is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that plays a crucial role in human social interactions. Recent developments in social neuroscience have provided valuable insights into the neural underpinnings and bodily mechanisms underlying empathy. This methodology often prioritizes precision, replicability, internal validity, and confound control. However, fully understanding the complexity of empathy seems unattainable by solely relying on artificial and controlled laboratory settings, while overlooking a comprehensive view of empathy through an ecological experimental approach. In this article, we propose articulating an integrative theoretical and methodological framework based on the 5E approach (the “E”s stand for\n              embodied, embedded, enacted, emotional, and extended perspectives of empathy\n              ), highlighting the relevance of studying empathy as an active interaction between embodied agents, embedded in a shared real-world environment. In addition, we illustrate how a novel multimodal approach including mobile brain and body imaging (MoBi) combined with phenomenological methods, and the implementation of interactive paradigms in a natural context, are adequate procedures to study empathy from the 5E approach. In doing so, we present the Empirical 5E approach (E5E) as an integrative scientific framework to bridge brain/body and phenomenological attributes in an interbody interactive setting. Progressing toward an E5E approach can be crucial to understanding empathy in accordance with the complexity of how it is experienced in the real world.",

      "abstractNote": "Empathic communication allows individuals to perceive and understand the feeling and emotion of the person with whom they are interacting. This could be particularly important during remote collaboration (such as remote assistance or distance learning) to enhance the social and emotional understanding of geographically distributed partners. However, supporting awareness in remote collaboration is very challenging especially when the interaction with the remote parties resulted in less information that can be communicated than in a physical interaction. We explore the effect of visualization using physiological cues that allow users to interpret emotional behaviors of remote parties with whom they are interacting in real time. The proposed visual representation allows users to infer emotional patterns from physiological cues that can potentially inﬂuence their communication approach toward a more aggressive style or maintain passive and peaceful interaction. We conducted a study involving participants who were paired up for a collaborative assessment task, interacting via voice only, videoconference, or a visual representation of the physiological measurements. Participants perceived the usage of our visual representation with higher group cohesiveness than using voice-only interaction. Further analysis shows that the visual representation significantly increases the positive affect score (i.e., participants are perceived to be more alert and demonstrate less distress) during remote collaboration. We discuss the possibilities of the proposed visual representation to support empathic communication during remote collaboration, and the beneﬁts to the remote partners of having positive affect and group cohesiveness.",

      "abstractNote": "Research on charismatic leadership has been criticized for the ambiguity of its central construct. Attempts to deﬁne and measure charisma have frequently treated it as a complex construct consisting of multiple components. However, little work has been done to develop a theoretical model that oﬀers a parsimonious rationale explaining why certain leadership attributes are considered “charismatic” while others are not, or how these attributes combine to produce charismatic eﬀects. Addressing these issues, we present a model that situates emotion as the primary variable in the charismatic process. We use recent research on the moral emotions to frame a theory of followership-relevant emotions (FREs) that describes how leaders use emotions such as compassion, admiration, and anger to compel their followers to act. We then discuss the Elicit-Channel (EC) model of charismatic leadership, positing that the charismatic relationship is a ﬁve-step, cyclical process. In the EC model, leaders elicit highly motivating emotions from their followers and then channel those emotions to produce action that, if successful, results in outcomes such as positive aﬀect and trust. These outcomes then enable the leader to continue the cycle, eliciting emotion once more. We conclude by oﬀering a research agenda, addressing potential methodological concerns, and discussing future directions.",

      "abstractNote": "Individuals that pay attention to narrative stimuli show synchronized heart rate (HR) and electrodermal activity (EDA) responses. The degree to which this physiological synchrony occurs is related to attentional engagement. Factors that can inﬂuence attention, such as instructions, salience of the narrative stimulus and characteristics of the individual, affect physiological synchrony. The demonstrability of synchrony depends on the amount of data used in the analysis. We investigated how demonstrability of physiological synchrony varies with varying group size and stimulus duration. Thirty participants watched six 10 min movie clips while their HR and EDA were monitored using wearable sensors (Movisens EdaMove 4 and Wahoo Tickr, respectively). We calculated inter-subject correlations as a measure of synchrony. Group size and stimulus duration were varied by using data from subsets of the participants and movie clips in the analysis. We found that for HR, higher synchrony correlated signiﬁcantly with the number of answers correct for questions about the movie, conﬁrming that physiological synchrony is associated with attention. For both HR and EDA, with increasing amounts of data used, the percentage of participants with signiﬁcant synchrony increased. Importantly, we found that it did not matter how the amount of data was increased. Increasing the group size or increasing the stimulus duration led to the same results. Initial comparisons with results from other studies suggest that our results do not only apply to our speciﬁc set of stimuli and participants. All in all, the current work can act as a guideline for future research, indicating the amount of data minimally needed for robust analysis of synchrony based on inter-subject correlations.",

Healthy volunteers (n = 106) completed a 240-item Big Five personality inventory, the state/ Trait Anxiety inventory, and a ten minute electrocardiographic recording. Time and frequency domain estimates of HRV were derived from the cardiac time series and related to the Big Five dimensions of personality, to personality types extracted from a cluster analysis, and to Trait Anxiety. Frequency domain measures of HRV (HRV-HF, LF/HF) were associated with speciﬁc dimensions of personality, but signiﬁcance was not noted for the time domain measure (STD-RR). Furthermore, distressed personality types exhibited signiﬁcantly greater autonomic imbalance (LF/HF) than other personality types. However, signiﬁcance was not noted for the time domain measure (STD-RR). These results can be explained with reference to a contemporary model of neurovisceral integration. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

      "abstractNote": "Team stress is an emergent cognition in which members jointly appraise their current task situations. The sharedness of stress appraisals has been elaborately studied in social groups such as couples, families, friends, and small communities. However, insights into teams have been rather limited. Keeping in mind the effects of stress on teams, it is essential to understand how team stress will form in teams over time. Seven dyad teams were observed during a 13-min flight simulation task. Researchers used the course of action analysis to reconstruct and distinguish one top-down (i.e., the shared stress configuration) and three bottom-up configuration types (i.e., the mimic, interactive, and independent stress configurations). Our findings suggest that especially the bottom-up influence of social stressors plays an important role in the team stress, especially when members verbally interact with one another. This proposes that, in comparison to the influence of contextual factors, diverse empathic processes play a more distinct role in the formation of team stress than initially thought in teams. This article also intends to illustrate how team stress can be studied over time, and how this type of output can contribute to a more fine-grained theoretical understanding of how team stress forms over time in teams. Last, it also provides some basic practical insights into the design of stress feedback systems.",

      "abstractNote": "Charismatic leaders have consistently been shown to affect followers' performance, motivation, and satisfaction. Yet, what precisely constitutes charisma still remains somewhat enigmatic. So far, research has mainly focused on leader traits, leader behaviors, or the leader follower-relationship, and the subsequent consequences of each on followers' self-concepts. All of these approaches share the notion that leader charisma depends on an explicit interaction between leader and follower. With the present review paper, we extend extant theorizing by arguing that charisma is additionally informed by embodied signals that ﬂow directly from either the leader or the immediate environment. We introduce the embodiment perspective on human perception and describe its utility for theoretically understanding the charismatic effect. Correspondingly, we review studies that show which concrete embodied cues can support the charismatic effect. Finally, we discuss the variety of new theoretical and practical implications that arise from this research and how they can complement existing approaches to charismatic leadership.",

      "abstractNote": "Charisma, the ability to attract and retain followers without beneﬁt of formal authority, is more diﬃcult to deﬁne than to identify. While we each seem able to identify charismatic individuals – and non-charismatic individuals – it is not clear what it is about an individual that inﬂuences our judgment. This paper describes the results of experiments designed to discover potential correlates of such judgments, in what speakers say and the way that they say it. We present results of two parallel experiments in which subjective judgments of charisma in spoken and in transcribed American political speech were analyzed with respect to the acoustic and prosodic (where applicable) and lexico-syntactic characteristics of the speech being assessed. While we ﬁnd that there is considerable disagreement among subjects on how the speakers of each token are ranked, we also ﬁnd that subjects appear to share a functional deﬁnition of charisma, in terms of other personal characteristics we asked them to rank speakers by. We also ﬁnd certain acoustic, prosodic, and lexico-syntactic characteristics that correlate signiﬁcantly with perceptions of charisma. Finally, by comparing the responses to spoken vs. transcribed stimuli, we attempt to distinguish between the contributions of ‘‘what is said” and ‘‘how it is said” with respect to charisma judgments.

      "abstractNote": "We adopt an interactionist perspective and extend previous work on personality and charismatic leadership by considering the relationship between them across contexts. Based on Gray's reinforcement sensitivity theory, we expected the relationships between approach‐oriented dispositions and charisma to diminish under conditions of high workload‐induced stress. In a large‐scale lab study with 201 groups (Study 1,\n              N\n              = 721 participants), we manipulated conditions of stress and tested the interaction of stress with leaders’ extraversion and openness to experience in predicting their charismatic behaviors. We then tested, in a field study of 71 executives (Study 2,\n              N\n              = 256 participants), the interaction of employees’ reported stress with leaders’ stimulation values in predicting their charismatic behavior. In support of our hypotheses, the relationships between approach‐oriented dispositions and charisma were significantly weaker when stress was high. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of this finding, in particular given that it is in stressful conditions under which charismatic leadership is said to be most important.",

The role of shared physiological dynamics to quantify interpersonal interaction, however, has received comparatively little attention. In the present study, we investigate the coordination dynamics of multiple psychophysiological measures and their utility in capturing emotional dynamics in teams. We use data from an experiment where teams of three people built origami boats together in an assembly-line manner while their heart rate, skin conductance, and facial muscle activity were recorded. Our results show that physiological synchrony of skin conductance measures and eletromyographic measures of the corrugator supercilii develops spontaneously among team members during this cooperative production task. Moreover, high team synchrony is found indicative of team cohesion, while low team synchrony is found indicative of a teams' decision to adopt a new behavior across multiple production sessions. We conclude that team-level measures of synchrony offer new and complementary information compared to measures of individual levels of physiological activity.",

Religious, societal, and organizational phases in the conceptualization of charisma are identified. The mutability of charisma has extended charismatic leadership theory from the domain of theology to multiple facets of the organizational sciences. Shifting conceptualizations of charisma that emphasize different elements have facilitated the study of leader traits, leader behaviors, situational contingencies, leader and organizational communications, and organizational cultures. These pluralistic conceptualizations of leadership and charisma have broadened our understanding of charismatic leadership. Yet, we must acknowledge that the breadth of knowledge we have gained has been at the expense of a more profound understanding of any one particular conceptualization of charisma.",

Due to limitations of emotional cues in computer-mediated collaboration (CMC), the collaborative process can be impacted. In this study, we report on the effect of an Emotion Awareness Tool (EAT) designed to facilitate the sharing of emotions between partners, on the perceived emotions after collaboration and the perceived quality of the interaction. Results showed that the EAT stimulated participants to engage in a mutual modeling of emotions. In the EAT condition, the perceived amount of time spent on emotion modeling process was positively correlated to the perceived intensity of positive emotions after collaboration. The EAT increased the perceived degree of transactivity, but only for women. This study provides a first step in exploring the effect of emotion awareness in CMC tasks including a comparing approach for its gender-specific relevance.",

      "abstractNote": "While early research on charismatic communication focused on charismatic language and more specifically rhetoric strategies, recent studies increasingly reveal the acoustic-prosodic features of charismatic speech. Furthermore, the development of the PASCAL score provided a complex metric which assesses the charisma level of a speaker’s acoustic voice profile. While this measurement of charismatic speech is attributional and hence assesses charisma through its impact on the listener, we may ask whether speakers whose voices are perceived as charismatic embody certain charismatic personality traits. We assessed the PASCAL charisma score as well as its individual acoustic features of 30 female speakers and correlated them with the Big Five personality traits. The results suggest that charismatic speech is not correlated with a charismatic personality, which supports the hypothesis that charismatic speech constitutes a skill that needs to be learned and is largely independent of personality. However, certain personality facets may facilitate speaker charisma and are correlated with acoustic features that make up charismatic speech. Specifically, assertiveness and activity correlate with a more charismatic f0 mean, articulation rate as well as phrase duration for female speakers, while facets such as anxiety, diligence and surprisingly gregariousness seem to be detrimental to speaker charisma.",

However, quantitative observational methods are challenging when teams are observed in the wild, that is, in their full-situated context. Technologically advanced tools that enable high-resolution measurements in the wild are rare and, when they exist, expensive. The present research advances highresolution measurement of team processes by introducing a technological application—the Communication Analysis Tool (CAT)—that captures fine-grained interactions in real workplace contexts. We introduce four core features of CAT: (a) customized coding measures, (b) session-based feedback on interrater reliability, (c) visualization and feedback options for displaying team dynamics, and (d) an export function to conduct advanced statistical analyses on effective team processes. We illustrate these core features using data from an organizational field project on multidisciplinary teams tasked with diagnosing patients with uncommon and highly complex medical conditions.",

However, the differences in communication styles between humans and AI often prevent human teammates from fully understanding the intent and needs of AI teammates. One core difference is that humans naturally leverage a positive emotional tone during communication to convey their confidence or lack thereof to convey doubt in their ability to complete a task. Yet, this communication strategy must be explicitly designed in order for an AI teammate to be human-centered. In this mixed-methods study, 45 participants completed a study examining how human teammates interpret the behaviors of their AI teammates when they express different positive emotions via specific words/phrases. Quantitative results show that, based on corresponding behaviors, AI teammates were able to use displays of emotion to increase trust in AI teammates and the positive mood of the human teammate. Additionally, our qualitative findings indicate that participants preferred their AI teammates to increase the intensity of their displayed emotions to help reduce the perceived risk of their AI teammate’s behavior. When taken in sum, these findings describe the relevance of AI teammates expressing intensities of emotion while performing various behavioral decisions as a continued means to provide social support to the wider team and better task performance.",

      "abstractNote": "This article takes a novel approach to understanding the phenomenon of charisma by viewing it through the frame of the aesthetic category of the sublime. It draws similarities between the account of the sublime as theorized by the Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant, and the theory of charismatic authority as rendered by Max Weber. The resulting analysis contributes insight into the phenomenon in three ways: it serves to locate the experience of charisma as a relational encounter rather than one situated solely within the leader him or herself, it highlights contextual factors which contribute to the experience of charismatic leadership, and it suggests a new way of distinguishing between generative and degenerative forms of charisma based in its relational quality rather than in outcomes associated it. The article concludes that, interpreted as an expression of the sublime, charismatic leadership functions as a means by which followers are empowered to wake up to their own sense of agency to respond in radical ways during times of crisis.",

We conducted a review of physiological measures used in research on teams to understand (1) how these measures are theoretically and operationally related to team constructs and (2) what types of validity evidence exist for physiological measurement in team settings.\nMethod: We identified 32 articles that investigated taskperforming teams using physiological data. Articles were coded on several dimensions, including team characteristics. Study findings were categorized by relationships tested between team physiological dynamics (TPD) and team inputs, mediators/processes, outputs, or psychometric properties.\nResults: TPD researchers overwhelmingly measure single physiological systems. Although there is research linking TPD to inputs and outputs, the research on processes is underdeveloped.\nConclusion: We recommend several theoretical, methodological, and statistical themes to expand the growth of the TPD field.",

      "abstractNote": "This article seeks to demonstrate that implicit within Weber’s writings on charisma are tools that can enable a processual, social constructionist understanding of charismatic formation. A corollary of this point is that Weber’s writings represent an historically crucial turning point in the progression from a Carlylian idea of leaders as inherently powerful to a non-essentialist, sociological perspective, and that Weber’s inspiration for this progression is best understood not through reference to his nineteenth-century forbearers in the social sciences, but rather in his contrast with the very few theological writers (namely Rudolph Sohm and the writers of the New Testament) who actually had employed charisma as a term prior to Weber’s famous appropriation of it. A reinterpretation and retranslation of Weber’s writings on charisma that gives priority to the social constructionist elements in his thought can provide tools for navigating through many of the interpretational controversies that have plagued charisma research.",

Emotional contagion is posited to engender emotional understanding and identification with others, a social process that acts as a mechanism that enables (or precludes) cooperative responses to opportunities and risks. Propositions are offered and further research is suggested.",

In a laboratory study, we examine team decision making over time and draw causal inferences about the relationships among team emotions, team performance, and explore–exploit decisions. We use self‐report data to measure team emotions, and validate results with psychophysiological data. We find that declines in performance increase the likelihood that teams decide to explore new routines rather than exploit existing ones. We also find a marginal positive effect of positive emotions, as measured by both self‐report and psychophysiological data, on team decisions to explore a new routine. Further, teams successful at implementing new routines report increased positive emotions, as measured by the self‐report data. This relationship is fully mediated by performance change.\n              Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstractNote": "This article explores the potential of emotional mimicry in identifying the leader and follower students in collaborative learning settings. Our data include video recorded interactions of 24 high school students who worked together in groups of three during a collaborative exam. A facial emotions recognition method was used to capture participants’ facial emotions during the collaborative work. Cross-recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis was applied on the detected facial emotions to see the level and direction of emotional mimicry among the dyads in the same groups. In order to validate the cross-recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis results, student interactions in terms of leading or following the task were video coded. Our ﬁndings showed that the leaders and followers identiﬁed by cross-recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis ﬁndings matched the leaders and followers identiﬁed by the video coding in 70 percent of the dyadic interactions across the collaborating groups. The current ﬁndings show that video-based facial emotions recognition as a method can add to collaborative learning research, especially explaining some social, and affective dynamics about it. The study further discusses the possible variables that might confound the relationship between emotional mimicry and leader-follower interactions during collaboration.",

      "abstractNote": "Emotional contagion is an intriguing subject in many academic fields, and it is also relevant in collaborative learning where learners share a physical or virtual space. We aimed at exploring the possibilities of motivating, fascinating, and experiential elements of virtual reality (VR) in a collaborative learning context, with a focus on emotional contagion. We adopted the eSports mode as a competency development strategy in collaborative learning, using VR to evaluate emotional contagion that is invoked between the presenters and spectators. For this purpose, we created a VR application (HHVR) that allows freshmen students to learn about the premises and academic life at a university. We then divided 43 adult participants into presenters (N = 9) and spectators (N = 34); the presenters experienced the HHVR application first-hand, whereas the spectators watched the experience through a monitor. We used a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews to measure what feelings of being — existential feelings that affect the way we react to the world — the participants experienced. The collected data were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis and qualitative data coding and the results revealed emotional contagion; the spectators who followed the presenters on a monitor showed similar emotional engagement with the presenters who used the application. In conclusion, the proposed eSports mode can be a useful pedagogical technique in the context of collaborative learning with VR, as it engages emotionally both the presenters and spectators. These findings can be helpful for designing emotionally engaging collaborative learning experiences with VR and for conducting group-based UX evaluations of VR applications.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper examines the interactions between selected coordination modes and dynamic team composition, and their joint effects on task performance under different task complexity and individual learning conditions. Prior research often treats dynamic team composition as a consequence of suboptimal organizational design choices. The emergence of new organizational forms that consciously employ teams that change their composition periodically challenges this perspective. In this paper, we follow the contingency theory and characterize dynamic team composition as a design choice that interacts with other choices such as the coordination mode, and with additional contextual factors such as individual learning and task complexity. We employ an agent-based modeling approach based on the NK framework, which includes a reinforcement learning mechanism, a recurring team formation mechanism based on signaling, and three different coordination modes. Our results suggest that by implementing lateral communication or sequential decision-making, teams may exploit the benefits of dynamic composition more than if decision-making is fully autonomous. The choice of a proper coordination mode, however, is partly moderated by the task complexity and individual learning. Additionally, we show that only a coordination mode based on lateral communication may prevent the negative effects of individual learning.",

      "abstractNote": "Collaborative problem-solving has been gaining attention as more and more students and employees work together all around the world to ﬁnd solutions to complex problems. This trend goes hand in hand with a growing interest in the role of affective processes in learning and problem-solving ﬁelds. However, the comprehension of real-time dynamics between emotional sharing and collaborative exchanges (what we propose to call “collaborative act”) still needs to be deepened. The challenge is especially on understanding the interplay between real-time changes in epistemic and relational dimensions. In this study, we propose to explore this question in dyadic creative problem-solving. Eleven pairs of participants used an argument graph tool to co-create a slogan against violence at school. The tool was used to write down slogans and build a joint map of the group argumentation. During the collaboration, they had access to an emotion awareness tool, allowing them to share emotional labels in real time. An indicator of real-time use was computed to track ongoing changes in collaborative acts during collaboration. Then, using both inferential and descriptive statistics, we ﬁrst investigated whether emotional sharing induces real-time adaptation of both emitter’s and receiver’s collaborative acts. Second, we looked at privileged relationships between emitter’s collaborative acts, emitter’s emotion sharing, and receiver’s collaborative acts. The preliminary results obtained (1) conﬁrm that emotional sharing regulates emitter’s and receiver’s collaborative acts and (2) strongly suggest that speciﬁc emotions mark speciﬁc patterns of collaboration in different collaborative phases, implying both the epistemic and the relational spaces of collaboration. These results highlight the value of studying emotional sharing for a deeper comprehension of the factors regulating collaborative problem-solving. Perspectives in educational psychology and computer science are considered, with the will to understand and promote better self- and co-regulation of collaborative problem-solving through emotional sharing.",

Religious, societal, and organizational phases in the conceptualization of charisma are identified. The mutability of charisma has extended charismatic leadership theory from the domain of theology to multiple facets of the organizational sciences. Shifting conceptualizations of charisma that emphasize different elements have facilitated the study of leader traits, leader behaviors, situational contingencies, leader and organizational communications, and organizational cultures. These pluralistic conceptualizations of leadership and charisma have broadened our understanding of charismatic leadership. Yet, we must acknowledge that the breadth of knowledge we have gained has been at the expense of a more profound understanding of any one particular conceptualization of charisma.",

      "abstractNote": "This article takes a novel approach to understanding the phenomenon of charisma by viewing it through the frame of the aesthetic category of the sublime. It draws similarities between the account of the sublime as theorized by the Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant, and the theory of charismatic authority as rendered by Max Weber. The resulting analysis contributes insight into the phenomenon in three ways: it serves to locate the experience of charisma as a relational encounter rather than one situated solely within the leader him or herself, it highlights contextual factors which contribute to the experience of charismatic leadership, and it suggests a new way of distinguishing between generative and degenerative forms of charisma based in its relational quality rather than in outcomes associated it. The article concludes that, interpreted as an expression of the sublime, charismatic leadership functions as a means by which followers are empowered to wake up to their own sense of agency to respond in radical ways during times of crisis.",

      "abstractNote": "This study advanced knowledge on charisma by (a) introducing a new personality-based model to conceptualize and assess charisma and by (b) investigating curvilinear relationships between charismatic personality and leader effectiveness. Moreover, we delved deeper into this curvilinear association by (c) examining moderation by the leader’s level of adjustment and by (d) testing a process model through which the effects of charismatic personality on effectiveness are explained with a consideration of specific leader behaviors. Study 1 validated HDS charisma (Hogan Development Survey) as a useful trait-based measure of charisma. In Study 2 a sample of leaders (N ϭ 306) were assessed in the context of a 360-degree development center. In line with the too-much-of-a-good-thing effect, an inverted U-shaped relationship between charismatic personality and observer-rated leader effectiveness was found, indicating that moderate levels are better than low or high levels of charisma. Study 3 (N ϭ 287) replicated this curvilinear relationship and further illustrated the moderating role of leader adjustment, in such a way that the inflection point after which the effects of charisma turn negative occurs at higher levels of charisma when adjustment is high. Nonlinear mediation modeling further confirmed that strategic and operational leader behaviors fully mediate the curvilinear relationship. Leaders low on charisma are less effective because they lack strategic behavior; highly charismatic leaders are less effective because they lack operational behavior. In sum, this work provides insight into the dispositional nature of charisma and uncovers the processes through which and conditions under which leader charisma translates into (in)effectiveness.",

      "abstractNote": "Charismatic leaders have consistently been shown to affect followers' performance, motivation, and satisfaction. Yet, what precisely constitutes charisma still remains somewhat enigmatic. So far, research has mainly focused on leader traits, leader behaviors, or the leader follower-relationship, and the subsequent consequences of each on followers' self-concepts. All of these approaches share the notion that leader charisma depends on an explicit interaction between leader and follower. With the present review paper, we extend extant theorizing by arguing that charisma is additionally informed by embodied signals that ﬂow directly from either the leader or the immediate environment. We introduce the embodiment perspective on human perception and describe its utility for theoretically understanding the charismatic effect. Correspondingly, we review studies that show which concrete embodied cues can support the charismatic effect. Finally, we discuss the variety of new theoretical and practical implications that arise from this research and how they can complement existing approaches to charismatic leadership.",

      "abstractNote": "Empathy is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that plays a crucial role in human social interactions. Recent developments in social neuroscience have provided valuable insights into the neural underpinnings and bodily mechanisms underlying empathy. This methodology often prioritizes precision, replicability, internal validity, and confound control. However, fully understanding the complexity of empathy seems unattainable by solely relying on artificial and controlled laboratory settings, while overlooking a comprehensive view of empathy through an ecological experimental approach. In this article, we propose articulating an integrative theoretical and methodological framework based on the 5E approach (the “E”s stand for\n              embodied, embedded, enacted, emotional, and extended perspectives of empathy\n              ), highlighting the relevance of studying empathy as an active interaction between embodied agents, embedded in a shared real-world environment. In addition, we illustrate how a novel multimodal approach including mobile brain and body imaging (MoBi) combined with phenomenological methods, and the implementation of interactive paradigms in a natural context, are adequate procedures to study empathy from the 5E approach. In doing so, we present the Empirical 5E approach (E5E) as an integrative scientific framework to bridge brain/body and phenomenological attributes in an interbody interactive setting. Progressing toward an E5E approach can be crucial to understanding empathy in accordance with the complexity of how it is experienced in the real world.",

      "abstractNote": "A key emergent property of group social dynamic is synchrony–the coordination of actions, emotions, or physiological processes between group members. Despite this fact and the inherent nested structure of groups, little research has assessed physiological synchronization between group members from a multi-level perspective, thus limiting a full understanding of the dynamics between members. To address this gap of knowledge we re-analyzed a large dataset (N = 261) comprising physiological and psychological data that were collected in two laboratory studies that involved two different social group tasks. In both studies, following the group task, members reported their experience of group cohesion via questionnaires. We utilized a nonlinear analysis method-multidimensional recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis that allowed us to represent physiological synchronization in cardiological interbeat intervals between group members at the individual-level and at the group-level. We found that across studies and their conditions, the change in physiological synchrony from baseline to group interaction predicted a psychological sense of group cohesion. This result was evident both at the individual and the group levels and was not modiﬁed by the context of the interaction. The individual- and group-level effects were highly correlated. These results indicate that the relationship between synchrony and cohesion is a multilayered construct. We re-afﬁrm the role of physiological synchrony for cohesion in groups. Future studies are needed to crystallize our understanding of the differences and similarities between synchrony at the individual-level and synchrony at the group level to illuminate under which conditions one of these levels has primacy, or how they interact.",

      "abstractNote": "Individuals that pay attention to narrative stimuli show synchronized heart rate (HR) and electrodermal activity (EDA) responses. The degree to which this physiological synchrony occurs is related to attentional engagement. Factors that can inﬂuence attention, such as instructions, salience of the narrative stimulus and characteristics of the individual, affect physiological synchrony. The demonstrability of synchrony depends on the amount of data used in the analysis. We investigated how demonstrability of physiological synchrony varies with varying group size and stimulus duration. Thirty participants watched six 10 min movie clips while their HR and EDA were monitored using wearable sensors (Movisens EdaMove 4 and Wahoo Tickr, respectively). We calculated inter-subject correlations as a measure of synchrony. Group size and stimulus duration were varied by using data from subsets of the participants and movie clips in the analysis. We found that for HR, higher synchrony correlated signiﬁcantly with the number of answers correct for questions about the movie, conﬁrming that physiological synchrony is associated with attention. For both HR and EDA, with increasing amounts of data used, the percentage of participants with signiﬁcant synchrony increased. Importantly, we found that it did not matter how the amount of data was increased. Increasing the group size or increasing the stimulus duration led to the same results. Initial comparisons with results from other studies suggest that our results do not only apply to our speciﬁc set of stimuli and participants. All in all, the current work can act as a guideline for future research, indicating the amount of data minimally needed for robust analysis of synchrony based on inter-subject correlations.",

Based on Gray's reinforcement sensitivity theory, we expected the relationships between approach‐oriented dispositions and charisma to diminish under conditions of high workload‐induced stress. In a large‐scale lab study with 201 groups (Study 1,\n              N\n              = 721 participants), we manipulated conditions of stress and tested the interaction of stress with leaders’ extraversion and openness to experience in predicting their charismatic behaviors. We then tested, in a field study of 71 executives (Study 2,\n              N\n              = 256 participants), the interaction of employees’ reported stress with leaders’ stimulation values in predicting their charismatic behavior. In support of our hypotheses, the relationships between approach‐oriented dispositions and charisma were significantly weaker when stress was high. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of this finding, in particular given that it is in stressful conditions under which charismatic leadership is said to be most important.",

      "abstractNote": "Occasionally, problems are solved with a sudden Aha! moment (insight), while the mundane approach to solving problems is analytical (non-insight). At first glance, non-insight appears to depend on the availability and taxation of cognitive resources to execute the step-by-step approach, whereas insight does not, or to a lesser extent. However, this remains debated. To investigate the reliance of both solution types on cognitive resources, we assessed the involvement of the prefrontal cortex using vagally mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV) as an index. Participants (N = 68) solved 70 compound remote associates word puzzles solvable with insight and non-insight. Before, during, and after solving the word puzzles, we measured the vmHRV. Our results showed that resting-state vmHRV (trait) showed a negative association with behavioural performance for both solution types. This might reflect inter-individual differences in inhibitory control. As the solution search requires one to think of remote associations, inhibitory control might hamper rather than aid this process. Furthermore, we observed, for both solution types, a vmHRV increase from resting-state to solution search (state), lingering on in the post-task recovery period. This could mark the increase of prefrontal resources to promote an open-minded stance, essential for divergent thinking, which arguably is crucial for this task. Our findings suggest that, at a general level, both solution types share common aspects. However, a closer analysis of early and late solutions and puzzle difficulty suggested that metacognitive differentiation between insight and non-insight improved with higher trait vmHRV, and that a unique association between trait vmHRV and puzzle difficulty was present for each solution type.",

Time and frequency domain estimates of HRV were derived from the cardiac time series and related to the Big Five dimensions of personality, to personality types extracted from a cluster analysis, and to Trait Anxiety. Frequency domain measures of HRV (HRV-HF, LF/HF) were associated with speciﬁc dimensions of personality, but signiﬁcance was not noted for the time domain measure (STD-RR). Furthermore, distressed personality types exhibited signiﬁcantly greater autonomic imbalance (LF/HF) than other personality types.

      "abstractNote": "Under the increasing inﬂuence of trait-perspectives on leadership, the current study introduces a personality-based measure of charisma. In order to obtain a Five-Factor Model (FFM) prototype for the charismatic leader, experts in the ﬁeld of leadership and personality research were invited to participate in an expert panel. For each of the 30 NEO PI-R facets, experts (N = 38) rated the prototypic case of a successful charismatic leader on a scale ranging between 1 (extremely low) and 9 (extremely high). Based on the FFM count technique (Miller, Bagby, Pilkonis, Reynolds, & Lynam, 2005), an easy-to-use count was developed in which facets that were rated as being prototypically high (≥7) or low (≤3) were summed together to calculate the FFM charisma score. To investigate the predictive validity of the FFM charisma count in terms of work-related outcomes, the 1994 Ghent alumni sample was used in which college alumni (N = 262) were administered the NEO PI-R before entering the labor market and 15 years later when their professional careers had unfolded. The results demonstrate that FFM charisma was positively related to extrinsic career outcomes 15 years later, including income, number of subordinates, and managerial level. Moreover, FFM charisma was positively associated with adaptive performance, and with career roles that directly relate to charismatic leadership. It is concluded that the FFM charisma compound provides opportunities to map charismatic tendencies in a career-relevant way.",

      "abstractNote": "Research on charismatic leadership has been criticized for the ambiguity of its central construct. Attempts to deﬁne and measure charisma have frequently treated it as a complex construct consisting of multiple components. However, little work has been done to develop a theoretical model that oﬀers a parsimonious rationale explaining why certain leadership attributes are considered “charismatic” while others are not, or how these attributes combine to produce charismatic eﬀects. Addressing these issues, we present a model that situates emotion as the primary variable in the charismatic process. We use recent research on the moral emotions to frame a theory of followership-relevant emotions (FREs) that describes how leaders use emotions such as compassion, admiration, and anger to compel their followers to act. We then discuss the Elicit-Channel (EC) model of charismatic leadership, positing that the charismatic relationship is a ﬁve-step, cyclical process. In the EC model, leaders elicit highly motivating emotions from their followers and then channel those emotions to produce action that, if successful, results in outcomes such as positive aﬀect and trust. These outcomes then enable the leader to continue the cycle, eliciting emotion once more. We conclude by oﬀering a research agenda, addressing potential methodological concerns, and discussing future directions.",

      "abstractNote": "While early research on charismatic communication focused on charismatic language and more specifically rhetoric strategies, recent studies increasingly reveal the acoustic-prosodic features of charismatic speech. Furthermore, the development of the PASCAL score provided a complex metric which assesses the charisma level of a speaker’s acoustic voice profile. While this measurement of charismatic speech is attributional and hence assesses charisma through its impact on the listener, we may ask whether speakers whose voices are perceived as charismatic embody certain charismatic personality traits. We assessed the PASCAL charisma score as well as its individual acoustic features of 30 female speakers and correlated them with the Big Five personality traits. The results suggest that charismatic speech is not correlated with a charismatic personality, which supports the hypothesis that charismatic speech constitutes a skill that needs to be learned and is largely independent of personality. However, certain personality facets may facilitate speaker charisma and are correlated with acoustic features that make up charismatic speech. Specifically, assertiveness and activity correlate with a more charismatic f0 mean, articulation rate as well as phrase duration for female speakers, while facets such as anxiety, diligence and surprisingly gregariousness seem to be detrimental to speaker charisma.",

      "abstractNote": "Charisma, the ability to attract and retain followers without beneﬁt of formal authority, is more diﬃcult to deﬁne than to identify. While we each seem able to identify charismatic individuals – and non-charismatic individuals – it is not clear what it is about an individual that inﬂuences our judgment. This paper describes the results of experiments designed to discover potential correlates of such judgments, in what speakers say and the way that they say it. We present results of two parallel experiments in which subjective judgments of charisma in spoken and in transcribed American political speech were analyzed with respect to the acoustic and prosodic (where applicable) and lexico-syntactic characteristics of the speech being assessed. While we ﬁnd that there is considerable disagreement among subjects on how the speakers of each token are ranked, we also ﬁnd that subjects appear to share a functional deﬁnition of charisma, in terms of other personal characteristics we asked them to rank speakers by. We also ﬁnd certain acoustic, prosodic, and lexico-syntactic characteristics that correlate signiﬁcantly with perceptions of charisma. Finally, by comparing the responses to spoken vs. transcribed stimuli, we attempt to distinguish between the contributions of ‘‘what is said” and ‘‘how it is said” with respect to charisma judgments.

      "abstractNote": "Charismatic leaders have consistently been shown to affect followers' performance, motivation, and satisfaction. Yet, what precisely constitutes charisma still remains somewhat enigmatic. So far, research has mainly focused on leader traits, leader behaviors, or the leader follower-relationship, and the subsequent consequences of each on followers' self-concepts. All of these approaches share the notion that leader charisma depends on an explicit interaction between leader and follower. With the present review paper, we extend extant theorizing by arguing that charisma is additionally informed by embodied signals that ﬂow directly from either the leader or the immediate environment. We introduce the embodiment perspective on human perception and describe its utility for theoretically understanding the charismatic effect. Correspondingly, we review studies that show which concrete embodied cues can support the charismatic effect. Finally, we discuss the variety of new theoretical and practical implications that arise from this research and how they can complement existing approaches to charismatic leadership.",

One issue that has been neglected is the disposition of the followers who form charismatic relationships with their leaders. To investigate this topic, we conducted a laboratory study in which participants' values and personality dimensions were used to predict participants' preferences for charismatic leadership vs. two other leadership styles: relationship-oriented and task-oriented leadership. The results showed that values and personality were useful in predicting leadership preferences. More research is needed to gain further insights into the active role of followers in the formation of charismatic relationships. D 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.",

Based on Gray's reinforcement sensitivity theory, we expected the relationships between approach‐oriented dispositions and charisma to diminish under conditions of high workload‐induced stress. In a large‐scale lab study with 201 groups (Study 1,\n              N\n              = 721 participants), we manipulated conditions of stress and tested the interaction of stress with leaders’ extraversion and openness to experience in predicting their charismatic behaviors. We then tested, in a field study of 71 executives (Study 2,\n              N\n              = 256 participants), the interaction of employees’ reported stress with leaders’ stimulation values in predicting their charismatic behavior. In support of our hypotheses, the relationships between approach‐oriented dispositions and charisma were significantly weaker when stress was high. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of this finding, in particular given that it is in stressful conditions under which charismatic leadership is said to be most important.",

      "abstractNote": "While early research on charismatic communication focused on charismatic language and more specifically rhetoric strategies, recent studies increasingly reveal the acoustic-prosodic features of charismatic speech. Furthermore, the development of the PASCAL score provided a complex metric which assesses the charisma level of a speaker’s acoustic voice profile. While this measurement of charismatic speech is attributional and hence assesses charisma through its impact on the listener, we may ask whether speakers whose voices are perceived as charismatic embody certain charismatic personality traits. We assessed the PASCAL charisma score as well as its individual acoustic features of 30 female speakers and correlated them with the Big Five personality traits. The results suggest that charismatic speech is not correlated with a charismatic personality, which supports the hypothesis that charismatic speech constitutes a skill that needs to be learned and is largely independent of personality. However, certain personality facets may facilitate speaker charisma and are correlated with acoustic features that make up charismatic speech. Specifically, assertiveness and activity correlate with a more charismatic f0 mean, articulation rate as well as phrase duration for female speakers, while facets such as anxiety, diligence and surprisingly gregariousness seem to be detrimental to speaker charisma.",

In Studies 1 and 2, ratings of charisma in a natural work setting were linked to leaders' positive emotional expressions. In Study 3, leaders' positive emotional expressions were linked to mood states of simulated followers. Results suggest that mood contagion may be one of the psychological mechanisms by which charismatic leaders influence followers. In Study 4, we used a trained actor and manipulated leaders' positive emotional expressions to isolate the effects of positive emotions from the potential effects of non-emotional aspects of effective leadership (e.g., vision, other inspirational influence processes). A positive link between leader emotions and follower mood was found. Results also indicate that both leaders' positive emotional expressions and follower mood influenced ratings of leader effectiveness and attraction to the leader.",

Religious, societal, and organizational phases in the conceptualization of charisma are identified. The mutability of charisma has extended charismatic leadership theory from the domain of theology to multiple facets of the organizational sciences. Shifting conceptualizations of charisma that emphasize different elements have facilitated the study of leader traits, leader behaviors, situational contingencies, leader and organizational communications, and organizational cultures. These pluralistic conceptualizations of leadership and charisma have broadened our understanding of charismatic leadership. Yet, we must acknowledge that the breadth of knowledge we have gained has been at the expense of a more profound understanding of any one particular conceptualization of charisma.",

It draws similarities between the account of the sublime as theorized by the Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant, and the theory of charismatic authority as rendered by Max Weber. The resulting analysis contributes insight into the phenomenon in three ways: it serves to locate the experience of charisma as a relational encounter rather than one situated solely within the leader him or herself, it highlights contextual factors which contribute to the experience of charismatic leadership, and it suggests a new way of distinguishing between generative and degenerative forms of charisma based in its relational quality rather than in outcomes associated it. The article concludes that, interpreted as an expression of the sublime, charismatic leadership functions as a means by which followers are empowered to wake up to their own sense of agency to respond in radical ways during times of crisis.",

Moreover, we delved deeper into this curvilinear association by (c) examining moderation by the leader’s level of adjustment and by (d) testing a process model through which the effects of charismatic personality on effectiveness are explained with a consideration of specific leader behaviors. Study 1 validated HDS charisma (Hogan Development Survey) as a useful trait-based measure of charisma. In Study 2 a sample of leaders (N ϭ 306) were assessed in the context of a 360-degree development center. In line with the too-much-of-a-good-thing effect, an inverted U-shaped relationship between charismatic personality and observer-rated leader effectiveness was found, indicating that moderate levels are better than low or high levels of charisma. Study 3 (N ϭ 287) replicated this curvilinear relationship and further illustrated the moderating role of leader adjustment, in such a way that the inflection point after which the effects of charisma turn negative occurs at higher levels of charisma when adjustment is high. Nonlinear mediation modeling further confirmed that strategic and operational leader behaviors fully mediate the curvilinear relationship. Leaders low on charisma are less effective because they lack strategic behavior; highly charismatic leaders are less effective because they lack operational behavior. In sum, this work provides insight into the dispositional nature of charisma and uncovers the processes through which and conditions under which leader charisma translates into (in)effectiveness.",

      "abstractNote": "Under the increasing inﬂuence of trait-perspectives on leadership, the current study introduces a personality-based measure of charisma. In order to obtain a Five-Factor Model (FFM) prototype for the charismatic leader, experts in the ﬁeld of leadership and personality research were invited to participate in an expert panel. For each of the 30 NEO PI-R facets, experts (N = 38) rated the prototypic case of a successful charismatic leader on a scale ranging between 1 (extremely low) and 9 (extremely high). Based on the FFM count technique (Miller, Bagby, Pilkonis, Reynolds, & Lynam, 2005), an easy-to-use count was developed in which facets that were rated as being prototypically high (≥7) or low (≤3) were summed together to calculate the FFM charisma score. To investigate the predictive validity of the FFM charisma count in terms of work-related outcomes, the 1994 Ghent alumni sample was used in which college alumni (N = 262) were administered the NEO PI-R before entering the labor market and 15 years later when their professional careers had unfolded. The results demonstrate that FFM charisma was positively related to extrinsic career outcomes 15 years later, including income, number of subordinates, and managerial level. Moreover, FFM charisma was positively associated with adaptive performance, and with career roles that directly relate to charismatic leadership. It is concluded that the FFM charisma compound provides opportunities to map charismatic tendencies in a career-relevant way.",

      "abstractNote": "Research on charismatic leadership has been criticized for the ambiguity of its central construct. Attempts to deﬁne and measure charisma have frequently treated it as a complex construct consisting of multiple components. However, little work has been done to develop a theoretical model that oﬀers a parsimonious rationale explaining why certain leadership attributes are considered “charismatic” while others are not, or how these attributes combine to produce charismatic eﬀects. Addressing these issues, we present a model that situates emotion as the primary variable in the charismatic process. We use recent research on the moral emotions to frame a theory of followership-relevant emotions (FREs) that describes how leaders use emotions such as compassion, admiration, and anger to compel their followers to act. We then discuss the Elicit-Channel (EC) model of charismatic leadership, positing that the charismatic relationship is a ﬁve-step, cyclical process. In the EC model, leaders elicit highly motivating emotions from their followers and then channel those emotions to produce action that, if successful, results in outcomes such as positive aﬀect and trust. These outcomes then enable the leader to continue the cycle, eliciting emotion once more. We conclude by oﬀering a research agenda, addressing potential methodological concerns, and discussing future directions.",

      "abstractNote": "This article seeks to demonstrate that implicit within Weber’s writings on charisma are tools that can enable a processual, social constructionist understanding of charismatic formation. A corollary of this point is that Weber’s writings represent an historically crucial turning point in the progression from a Carlylian idea of leaders as inherently powerful to a non-essentialist, sociological perspective, and that Weber’s inspiration for this progression is best understood not through reference to his nineteenth-century forbearers in the social sciences, but rather in his contrast with the very few theological writers (namely Rudolph Sohm and the writers of the New Testament) who actually had employed charisma as a term prior to Weber’s famous appropriation of it. A reinterpretation and retranslation of Weber’s writings on charisma that gives priority to the social constructionist elements in his thought can provide tools for navigating through many of the interpretational controversies that have plagued charisma research.",

While we each seem able to identify charismatic individuals – and non-charismatic individuals – it is not clear what it is about an individual that inﬂuences our judgment. This paper describes the results of experiments designed to discover potential correlates of such judgments, in what speakers say and the way that they say it. We present results of two parallel experiments in which subjective judgments of charisma in spoken and in transcribed American political speech were analyzed with respect to the acoustic and prosodic (where applicable) and lexico-syntactic characteristics of the speech being assessed. While we ﬁnd that there is considerable disagreement among subjects on how the speakers of each token are ranked, we also ﬁnd that subjects appear to share a functional deﬁnition of charisma, in terms of other personal characteristics we asked them to rank speakers by. We also ﬁnd certain acoustic, prosodic, and lexico-syntactic characteristics that correlate signiﬁcantly with perceptions of charisma. Finally, by comparing the responses to spoken vs. transcribed stimuli, we attempt to distinguish between the contributions of ‘‘what is said” and ‘‘how it is said” with respect to charisma judgments.

      "abstractNote": "Two studies were conducted to test the hypothesis that charismatic leadership, characterized by nonverbal expressiveness and immediacy, would lead via emotional contagion to the imitation of the leader's nonverbal behavior. In Study I, charismatic leaders were college students whose performance of a simulated campaign speech included more smiles, more intense smiles, and longer and more frequent visual attention to the audience. Observers showed higher levels of all 4 relevant behaviors while watching charismatic leaders. In Study 2, college student participants watched more and less charismatic excerpts selected from President Clinton's and ex‐President Bush's responses during their first 1992 televised debate. Comparing the same behaviors, there was a similar pattern to Study I for responses to the Clinton excerpts, and an almost reversed pattern for the Bush excerpts. The overall results support an emotional contagion effect of charismatic leadership when the leader exhibits truly charismatic behavior.",

Does this social capital affect team performance because subordinates come to see the leader as charismatic? We answered this question by examining 2 models. First, we tested the charisma-to-centrality model according to which the leader’s charisma facilitates the occupation of a central position in the informal advice network. From this central position, the leader positively influences team performance. Second, we examined the centrality-to-charisma model according to which charisma is attributed to those leaders who are socially active in terms of giving and receiving advice. Attributed charisma facilitates increased team performance. We tested these 2 models in 2 different studies. In the first study, based on time-separated, multisource data emanating from members of 56 work teams, we found support for the centrality-to-charisma model. Formal leaders who were central within team advice networks were seen as charismatic by subordinates, and this charisma was associated with high team performance. To clarify how leader network centrality affected the emergence of charismatic leadership, we designed Study 2 in which, for 79 student teams, we measured leader networking activity and leader charisma at 2 different points in time and related these variables to team performance measured at a third point in time. On the basis of this temporally separated data set, we again found support for the centrality-to-charisma model.",

Despite the positive attention received by the charisma construct, some have criticized its conceptualization and measurement. These critiques have, in turn, cast doubt on what we know regarding the antecedents and outcomes of charismatic leadership. In this review, we adopt a recently developed deﬁnition of charismatic leadership and then conduct a meta-analysis of its antecedents and objective outcomes. Following an examination of 76 independent studies and 36,031 individuals, results indicate that the Big Five traits and cognitive ability vary in their association with charismatic leadership. Other ﬁndings show that dimensions of charismatic leadership predict outcomes of interest, such as supervisorrated task performance, supervisor-rated citizenship behaviors, and group or organization performance. Several shortcomings are identiﬁed, however, in testing theoretical and methodological moderating variables. The present research ultimately provides a roadmap for new frontiers in theoretical, measurement and empirical work on charismatic leadership.",
