      "abstractNote": "Two studies were conducted to test the hypothesis that charismatic leadership, characterized by nonverbal expressiveness and immediacy, would lead via emotional contagion to the imitation of the leader's nonverbal behavior. In Study I, charismatic leaders were college students whose performance of a simulated campaign speech included more smiles, more intense smiles, and longer and more frequent visual attention to the audience. Observers showed higher levels of all 4 relevant behaviors while watching charismatic leaders. In Study 2, college student participants watched more and less charismatic excerpts selected from President Clinton's and ex‐President Bush's responses during their first 1992 televised debate. Comparing the same behaviors, there was a similar pattern to Study I for responses to the Clinton excerpts, and an almost reversed pattern for the Bush excerpts. The overall results support an emotional contagion effect of charismatic leadership when the leader exhibits truly charismatic behavior.",

      "abstractNote": "Collective rituals involve the coordination of intentions and actions and have been shown to promote the alignment of emotional states and social identities. However, the mechanics of achieving group-level synchrony is yet unclear. We report the results of a naturalistic study in the context of an Islamic congregational prayer that involves synchronous movement. We used wearable devices to capture data on body posture, autonomic responses and spatial proximity to investigate how postural alignment and shared arousal intertwine during this ritual. The findings reveal a dual process at play: postural alignment appears to be more localized, with worshippers synchronizing their movements with their nearest neighbours, while physiological alignment operates on a broader scale, primarily driven by the central role of the religious leader. Our findings underscore the importance of interpersonal dynamics in collective gatherings and the role of physical co-presence in fostering connections among participants, with implications extending to our understanding of group dynamics across various social settings.\n            This article is part of the theme issue ‘Minds in movement: embodied cognition in the age of artificial intelligence’.",

      "abstractNote": "Our global society is experiencing an extreme and urgent need for effective STEM problem solvers who are ready to tackle the grand challenges of the twenty-first century. However, indicators are also suggesting that curriculum for undergraduate STEM is overly prescriptive and not based upon authentic practices, and are thus not representative of the professions and unattractive to the widest possible population of students. To address this problem, this chapter conceptualizes collaborative problem solving as a core STEM practice and takes a design-based approach to the discussion of conceptual and empirical research on scaffolding the process with cyberlearning. Cyberlearning, or the use of networked learning technologies, can transform the scaffolding of both individual and collective cognition because it provides affordances for learners to engage in such important cognitive and metacognitive processes as problem definition, information discrimination, reasoning and argumentation, solution negotiation and evaluation. In addition to supporting learners’ cognitive processes, such as elaboration or problem categorization, cyberlearning environments scaffold metacognition—that is, planning, differentiating forms of knowledge and information, as well as monitoring, and reflective activities. Similar to the scaffolding of cognition, cyberlearning technologies allow designers to create supports for both individual learners’ metacognition (i.e., self-regulation) as well as team metacognition (i.e., socially shared regulation). The design-based approach we describe in this chapter leverages the complex interplay among cognition and metacognition to generate engaging and inclusive cyberlearning experiences. We begin by reviewing the existing theories that inform the complex process, then translate these theories into a design framework that defines a STEM learning environment based upon collaborative problem solving. Drawing from current examples, the design is instantiated as cyberlearning by aligning the needs of the activities and experiences with the affordances of contemporary technologies. We conclude the chapter with the implications of our approach for future research, teaching and assessment.",

In this article, the researchers aimed to observe postgraduate and undergraduate students metacognitive strategies in reading. Reading is a memory construction, it is essential for successes in the future. Students who are self-determined and motivated are successful readers. Metacognitive strategies of student teachers in reading maturity inspire students to integrate ideas with experiences into the transformation of actions. As reading maturity shapes character, it is identified to those who are independently and eagerly participates in the activity. It focuses on critical thinking and reflection. This assessment of metacognitive strategies in reading may offer an idea to be a good readers and teachers in the future. Using mixed method approach, particularly questionnaires and interviews, the data were collected using procedural statistic SPSS independent t-test in order to have the description of how the two groups applied metacognitive strategies in reading. The findings showed that both postgraduate and undergraduate students utilized metacognition strategies. However, postgraduate students demonstrated more metacognitive strategies and maturity in reading.",

      "abstractNote": "Reader expectations form across hierarchical scales of discourse (e.g., from coarse to fine: genre, narrative, syntax). Cross-scale interactivity produces word reading times (RTs) with multifractal structure. After introducing multifractals, we test two hypotheses regarding their relevance to reader expectations: (1) multifractal evidence of cross-scale interactions from RTs preceding violation of expectations would interact with mean reading speed to predict RTs immediately after the expectation violation and (2) postsurprise RTs would exhibit stronger cross-scale interactions. Thirty-four adult participants read one of two 2,000-word stories that used gender stereotypes to suggest that an ambiguously named protagonist was male. However, the stories postponed gender information until word 1,000: male in one story and female in the other. For slower readers, cross-scale interactions accentuated postreveal slowing but also minimized subsequent pausing over 15 postreveal RTs. Surprise strengthened cross-scale interactions over all postsurprise RTs. These results suggest that multifractality may index anticipation across multiple scales of discourse.",

      "abstractNote": "Objective In social interactions, humans tend to naturally synchronize their body movements. We investigated interpersonal synchronization in conversations and examined its relationship with personality differences and post-interaction appraisals. Method In a 15-minute semi-structured conversation, 56 previously-unfamiliar dyads introduced themselves, followed by self-disclosing and argumentative conversations. Their bodily movements were video-recorded in a standardized room (112 young adults, aged 18–33, mean = 20.54, SD = 2.74; 58% Dutch, 31% German, 11% other). Interpersonal bodily synchronization was estimated as (a) synchronization strength using Windowed Lagged Cross-Correlations and (b) Dynamic Organization (Determinism/Entropy/Laminarity/Mean Line) using Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis. Bodily synchronization was associated with differences in Agreeableness and Extraversion (IPIP-NEO-120) and post-conversational appraisals (affect/closeness/enjoyment) in mixed-effect models. Results Agreeable participants exhibited higher complexity in bodily synchronization dynamics (higher Entropy) than disagreeable individuals, who also reported more negative affect afterward. Interpersonal synchronization was stronger among extroverts than among introverts and extroverts appraised conversations as more positive and enjoyable. Bodily synchronization strength and dynamic organization were related to the type of conversation (self-disclosing/argumentative). Conclusions Interpersonal dynamics were intimately connected to differences in Agreeableness and Extraversion, varied across situations, and these parameters affected how pleasant, close, and enjoyable each conversation felt.",

      "abstractNote": "Complex behaviors are layered with processes across timescales that must be coordinated with each other to accomplish cooperative goals. Complexity matching is the coordination of nested layers of behaviors across individuals. We hypothesize that complexity matching extends across individuals and their respective layers of processes when cooperating in joint tasks. We measured coordination in a joint tower building task through the layers of sound and movement patterns produced by partners and found that partners built higher towers when their sound patterns fell into more similar relations with each other across timescales, as measured by complexity matching. Our findings shed light on the function of complexity matching and lead to new hypotheses about multiscale coordination and communication. We discuss how complexity matching encompasses flexible and complementary dynamics between partners that support complex acts of human coordination.",

      "abstractNote": "Any adequate account of emotion must accommodate the fact that emotions, even those of the most basic kind, exhibit intentionality as well as phenomenality. This article argues that a good place to start in providing such an account is by adjusting Prinz?s (2004) embodied appraisal theory (EAT) of emotions. EAT appeals to teleosemantics in order to account for the world-directed content of embodied appraisals. Although the central idea behind EAT is essentially along the right lines, as it stands Prinz?s proposal needs tweaking in a number of ways. This article focuses on one?the need to free it from its dependence on teleosemantics. EAT, so modified, becomes compatible with a truly enactivist understanding of basic emotions.",

However, the differences in communication styles between humans and AI often prevent human teammates from fully understanding the intent and needs of AI teammates. One core difference is that humans naturally leverage a positive emotional tone during communication to convey their confidence or lack thereof to convey doubt in their ability to complete a task. Yet, this communication strategy must be explicitly designed in order for an AI teammate to be human-centered. In this mixed-methods study, 45 participants completed a study examining how human teammates interpret the behaviors of their AI teammates when they express different positive emotions via specific words/phrases. Quantitative results show that, based on corresponding behaviors, AI teammates were able to use displays of emotion to increase trust in AI teammates and the positive mood of the human teammate. Additionally, our qualitative findings indicate that participants preferred their AI teammates to increase the intensity of their displayed emotions to help reduce the perceived risk of their AI teammate’s behavior. When taken in sum, these findings describe the relevance of AI teammates expressing intensities of emotion while performing various behavioral decisions as a continued means to provide social support to the wider team and better task performance.",

      "abstractNote": "Team stress is an emergent cognition in which members jointly appraise their current task situations. The sharedness of stress appraisals has been elaborately studied in social groups such as couples, families, friends, and small communities. However, insights into teams have been rather limited. Keeping in mind the effects of stress on teams, it is essential to understand how team stress will form in teams over time. Seven dyad teams were observed during a 13-min flight simulation task. Researchers used the course of action analysis to reconstruct and distinguish one top-down (i.e., the shared stress configuration) and three bottom-up configuration types (i.e., the mimic, interactive, and independent stress configurations). Our findings suggest that especially the bottom-up influence of social stressors plays an important role in the team stress, especially when members verbally interact with one another. This proposes that, in comparison to the influence of contextual factors, diverse empathic processes play a more distinct role in the formation of team stress than initially thought in teams. This article also intends to illustrate how team stress can be studied over time, and how this type of output can contribute to a more fine-grained theoretical understanding of how team stress forms over time in teams. Last, it also provides some basic practical insights into the design of stress feedback systems.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper examines the interactions between selected coordination modes and dynamic team composition, and their joint effects on task performance under different task complexity and individual learning conditions. Prior research often treats dynamic team composition as a consequence of suboptimal organizational design choices. The emergence of new organizational forms that consciously employ teams that change their composition periodically challenges this perspective. In this paper, we follow the contingency theory and characterize dynamic team composition as a design choice that interacts with other choices such as the coordination mode, and with additional contextual factors such as individual learning and task complexity. We employ an agent-based modeling approach based on the NK framework, which includes a reinforcement learning mechanism, a recurring team formation mechanism based on signaling, and three different coordination modes. Our results suggest that by implementing lateral communication or sequential decision-making, teams may exploit the benefits of dynamic composition more than if decision-making is fully autonomous. The choice of a proper coordination mode, however, is partly moderated by the task complexity and individual learning. Additionally, we show that only a coordination mode based on lateral communication may prevent the negative effects of individual learning.",

      "abstractNote": "In recent years, many agent-based models of human groups have implemented a mechanism of emotion contagion, yet empirical validation is lagging behind. The aim of the present paper is to validate an agent-based model of emotion contagion at the level of group emotion, by comparing simulations against the emotional development of real people in small groups. To study the effect of emotion contagion, the participants interacted via a video call, where they were virtually placed in different social environments while they played a quiz. This allowed the exchange of emotion among all, some or none of the participants. The patterns of emotional development in the empirical results supported our hypotheses based on literature of emotion contagion and social norms. Further, the simulations with the complete model resembled many of these patterns. When emotion contagion was disabled in the model, the resemblance decreased. These results give a ﬁrst indication that emotion contagion occurs in groups that meet via video calls, and can in-part be predicted by the proposed model of emotion contagion. Yet, further study with a larger and more diverse empirical sample is needed, as well as comparisons across contagion mechanisms, to draw stronger conclusions and ultimately justify societal application.",

The role of shared physiological dynamics to quantify interpersonal interaction, however, has received comparatively little attention. In the present study, we investigate the coordination dynamics of multiple psychophysiological measures and their utility in capturing emotional dynamics in teams. We use data from an experiment where teams of three people built origami boats together in an assembly-line manner while their heart rate, skin conductance, and facial muscle activity were recorded. Our results show that physiological synchrony of skin conductance measures and eletromyographic measures of the corrugator supercilii develops spontaneously among team members during this cooperative production task. Moreover, high team synchrony is found indicative of team cohesion, while low team synchrony is found indicative of a teams' decision to adopt a new behavior across multiple production sessions. We conclude that team-level measures of synchrony offer new and complementary information compared to measures of individual levels of physiological activity.",

We conducted a review of physiological measures used in research on teams to understand (1) how these measures are theoretically and operationally related to team constructs and (2) what types of validity evidence exist for physiological measurement in team settings.\nMethod: We identified 32 articles that investigated taskperforming teams using physiological data. Articles were coded on several dimensions, including team characteristics. Study findings were categorized by relationships tested between team physiological dynamics (TPD) and team inputs, mediators/processes, outputs, or psychometric properties.\nResults: TPD researchers overwhelmingly measure single physiological systems. Although there is research linking TPD to inputs and outputs, the research on processes is underdeveloped.\nConclusion: We recommend several theoretical, methodological, and statistical themes to expand the growth of the TPD field.",

      "abstractNote": "Capturing team processes, which are highly dynamic and quickly unfold over time, requires methods that go beyond standard self-report measures. However, quantitative observational methods are challenging when teams are observed in the wild, that is, in their full-situated context. Technologically advanced tools that enable high-resolution measurements in the wild are rare and, when they exist, expensive. The present research advances highresolution measurement of team processes by introducing a technological application—the Communication Analysis Tool (CAT)—that captures fine-grained interactions in real workplace contexts. We introduce four core features of CAT: (a) customized coding measures, (b) session-based feedback on interrater reliability, (c) visualization and feedback options for displaying team dynamics, and (d) an export function to conduct advanced statistical analyses on effective team processes. We illustrate these core features using data from an organizational field project on multidisciplinary teams tasked with diagnosing patients with uncommon and highly complex medical conditions.",

      "abstractNote": "Emotional contagion is an intriguing subject in many academic fields, and it is also relevant in collaborative learning where learners share a physical or virtual space. We aimed at exploring the possibilities of motivating, fascinating, and experiential elements of virtual reality (VR) in a collaborative learning context, with a focus on emotional contagion. We adopted the eSports mode as a competency development strategy in collaborative learning, using VR to evaluate emotional contagion that is invoked between the presenters and spectators. For this purpose, we created a VR application (HHVR) that allows freshmen students to learn about the premises and academic life at a university. We then divided 43 adult participants into presenters (N = 9) and spectators (N = 34); the presenters experienced the HHVR application first-hand, whereas the spectators watched the experience through a monitor. We used a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews to measure what feelings of being — existential feelings that affect the way we react to the world — the participants experienced. The collected data were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis and qualitative data coding and the results revealed emotional contagion; the spectators who followed the presenters on a monitor showed similar emotional engagement with the presenters who used the application. In conclusion, the proposed eSports mode can be a useful pedagogical technique in the context of collaborative learning with VR, as it engages emotionally both the presenters and spectators. These findings can be helpful for designing emotionally engaging collaborative learning experiences with VR and for conducting group-based UX evaluations of VR applications.",

Our data include video recorded interactions of 24 high school students who worked together in groups of three during a collaborative exam. A facial emotions recognition method was used to capture participants’ facial emotions during the collaborative work. Cross-recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis was applied on the detected facial emotions to see the level and direction of emotional mimicry among the dyads in the same groups. In order to validate the cross-recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis results, student interactions in terms of leading or following the task were video coded. Our ﬁndings showed that the leaders and followers identiﬁed by cross-recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis ﬁndings matched the leaders and followers identiﬁed by the video coding in 70 percent of the dyadic interactions across the collaborating groups. The current ﬁndings show that video-based facial emotions recognition as a method can add to collaborative learning research, especially explaining some social, and affective dynamics about it. The study further discusses the possible variables that might confound the relationship between emotional mimicry and leader-follower interactions during collaboration.",

It takes as a premise that a necessary prerequisite for organizing, or “protoorganizing,” occurs through emotional contagion in subpopulations of human interaction dynamics in complex ecosystems. Emotional contagion is posited to engender emotional understanding and identification with others, a social process that acts as a mechanism that enables (or precludes) cooperative responses to opportunities and risks. Propositions are offered and further research is suggested.",

      "abstractNote": "Collaborative problem-solving has been gaining attention as more and more students and employees work together all around the world to ﬁnd solutions to complex problems. This trend goes hand in hand with a growing interest in the role of affective processes in learning and problem-solving ﬁelds. However, the comprehension of real-time dynamics between emotional sharing and collaborative exchanges (what we propose to call “collaborative act”) still needs to be deepened. The challenge is especially on understanding the interplay between real-time changes in epistemic and relational dimensions. In this study, we propose to explore this question in dyadic creative problem-solving. Eleven pairs of participants used an argument graph tool to co-create a slogan against violence at school. The tool was used to write down slogans and build a joint map of the group argumentation. During the collaboration, they had access to an emotion awareness tool, allowing them to share emotional labels in real time. An indicator of real-time use was computed to track ongoing changes in collaborative acts during collaboration. Then, using both inferential and descriptive statistics, we ﬁrst investigated whether emotional sharing induces real-time adaptation of both emitter’s and receiver’s collaborative acts. Second, we looked at privileged relationships between emitter’s collaborative acts, emitter’s emotion sharing, and receiver’s collaborative acts. The preliminary results obtained (1) conﬁrm that emotional sharing regulates emitter’s and receiver’s collaborative acts and (2) strongly suggest that speciﬁc emotions mark speciﬁc patterns of collaboration in different collaborative phases, implying both the epistemic and the relational spaces of collaboration. These results highlight the value of studying emotional sharing for a deeper comprehension of the factors regulating collaborative problem-solving. Perspectives in educational psychology and computer science are considered, with the will to understand and promote better self- and co-regulation of collaborative problem-solving through emotional sharing.",

This article explores what collaborators understand about each other’s emotions and the potential beneﬁts for performance that might come from raising this understanding. In Experiment 1 co-located collaborators judged each other’s emotions after playing a game that required cooperative data collection and analysis. Their judgements were largely inaccurate and based on their own emotions, suggesting limited emotion understanding. Experiment 2 explored if this could be overcome by making collaborators aware of each other’s emotions. Co-located and remote collaborators played a cooperative puzzle-solving game under conditions of awareness or no awareness. Awareness was manipulated by making collaborators share their self-reported emotions during key moments of their game play. Both remote and co-located collaborators improved their performance after sharing their emotions. However, unlike co-located collaborators, remote collaborators also improved their understanding of each other’s emotions and experienced more positive affect. We conclude by discussing the content of collaborators’ emotion understanding and the probable mechanisms underlying the observed effects of being made aware of a partner’s emotions.",

      "abstractNote": "Emotions play a crucial role in collaboration. They help to make inferences about the partner and can strongly influence task performance. Due to limitations of emotional cues in computer-mediated collaboration (CMC), the collaborative process can be impacted. In this study, we report on the effect of an Emotion Awareness Tool (EAT) designed to facilitate the sharing of emotions between partners, on the perceived emotions after collaboration and the perceived quality of the interaction. Results showed that the EAT stimulated participants to engage in a mutual modeling of emotions. In the EAT condition, the perceived amount of time spent on emotion modeling process was positively correlated to the perceived intensity of positive emotions after collaboration. The EAT increased the perceived degree of transactivity, but only for women. This study provides a first step in exploring the effect of emotion awareness in CMC tasks including a comparing approach for its gender-specific relevance.",

      "abstractNote": "Empathic communication allows individuals to perceive and understand the feeling and emotion of the person with whom they are interacting. This could be particularly important during remote collaboration (such as remote assistance or distance learning) to enhance the social and emotional understanding of geographically distributed partners. However, supporting awareness in remote collaboration is very challenging especially when the interaction with the remote parties resulted in less information that can be communicated than in a physical interaction. We explore the effect of visualization using physiological cues that allow users to interpret emotional behaviors of remote parties with whom they are interacting in real time. The proposed visual representation allows users to infer emotional patterns from physiological cues that can potentially inﬂuence their communication approach toward a more aggressive style or maintain passive and peaceful interaction. We conducted a study involving participants who were paired up for a collaborative assessment task, interacting via voice only, videoconference, or a visual representation of the physiological measurements. Participants perceived the usage of our visual representation with higher group cohesiveness than using voice-only interaction. Further analysis shows that the visual representation significantly increases the positive affect score (i.e., participants are perceived to be more alert and demonstrate less distress) during remote collaboration. We discuss the possibilities of the proposed visual representation to support empathic communication during remote collaboration, and the beneﬁts to the remote partners of having positive affect and group cohesiveness.",

      "abstractNote": "Research on charismatic leadership has been criticized for the ambiguity of its central construct. Attempts to deﬁne and measure charisma have frequently treated it as a complex construct consisting of multiple components. However, little work has been done to develop a theoretical model that oﬀers a parsimonious rationale explaining why certain leadership attributes are considered “charismatic” while others are not, or how these attributes combine to produce charismatic eﬀects. Addressing these issues, we present a model that situates emotion as the primary variable in the charismatic process. We use recent research on the moral emotions to frame a theory of followership-relevant emotions (FREs) that describes how leaders use emotions such as compassion, admiration, and anger to compel their followers to act. We then discuss the Elicit-Channel (EC) model of charismatic leadership, positing that the charismatic relationship is a ﬁve-step, cyclical process. In the EC model, leaders elicit highly motivating emotions from their followers and then channel those emotions to produce action that, if successful, results in outcomes such as positive aﬀect and trust. These outcomes then enable the leader to continue the cycle, eliciting emotion once more. We conclude by oﬀering a research agenda, addressing potential methodological concerns, and discussing future directions.",

      "abstractNote": "This article seeks to demonstrate that implicit within Weber’s writings on charisma are tools that can enable a processual, social constructionist understanding of charismatic formation. A corollary of this point is that Weber’s writings represent an historically crucial turning point in the progression from a Carlylian idea of leaders as inherently powerful to a non-essentialist, sociological perspective, and that Weber’s inspiration for this progression is best understood not through reference to his nineteenth-century forbearers in the social sciences, but rather in his contrast with the very few theological writers (namely Rudolph Sohm and the writers of the New Testament) who actually had employed charisma as a term prior to Weber’s famous appropriation of it. A reinterpretation and retranslation of Weber’s writings on charisma that gives priority to the social constructionist elements in his thought can provide tools for navigating through many of the interpretational controversies that have plagued charisma research.",

      "abstractNote": "Charisma, the ability to attract and retain followers without beneﬁt of formal authority, is more diﬃcult to deﬁne than to identify. While we each seem able to identify charismatic individuals – and non-charismatic individuals – it is not clear what it is about an individual that inﬂuences our judgment. This paper describes the results of experiments designed to discover potential correlates of such judgments, in what speakers say and the way that they say it. We present results of two parallel experiments in which subjective judgments of charisma in spoken and in transcribed American political speech were analyzed with respect to the acoustic and prosodic (where applicable) and lexico-syntactic characteristics of the speech being assessed. While we ﬁnd that there is considerable disagreement among subjects on how the speakers of each token are ranked, we also ﬁnd that subjects appear to share a functional deﬁnition of charisma, in terms of other personal characteristics we asked them to rank speakers by. We also ﬁnd certain acoustic, prosodic, and lexico-syntactic characteristics that correlate signiﬁcantly with perceptions of charisma. Finally, by comparing the responses to spoken vs. transcribed stimuli, we attempt to distinguish between the contributions of ‘‘what is said” and ‘‘how it is said” with respect to charisma judgments.

      "abstractNote": "This article reveals the mutability of charisma by tracing changes in the conceptualization of charisma throughout the history of leadership research. Religious, societal, and organizational phases in the conceptualization of charisma are identified. The mutability of charisma has extended charismatic leadership theory from the domain of theology to multiple facets of the organizational sciences. Shifting conceptualizations of charisma that emphasize different elements have facilitated the study of leader traits, leader behaviors, situational contingencies, leader and organizational communications, and organizational cultures. These pluralistic conceptualizations of leadership and charisma have broadened our understanding of charismatic leadership. Yet, we must acknowledge that the breadth of knowledge we have gained has been at the expense of a more profound understanding of any one particular conceptualization of charisma.",

      "abstractNote": "This article takes a novel approach to understanding the phenomenon of charisma by viewing it through the frame of the aesthetic category of the sublime. It draws similarities between the account of the sublime as theorized by the Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant, and the theory of charismatic authority as rendered by Max Weber. The resulting analysis contributes insight into the phenomenon in three ways: it serves to locate the experience of charisma as a relational encounter rather than one situated solely within the leader him or herself, it highlights contextual factors which contribute to the experience of charismatic leadership, and it suggests a new way of distinguishing between generative and degenerative forms of charisma based in its relational quality rather than in outcomes associated it. The article concludes that, interpreted as an expression of the sublime, charismatic leadership functions as a means by which followers are empowered to wake up to their own sense of agency to respond in radical ways during times of crisis.",

In Studies 1 and 2, ratings of charisma in a natural work setting were linked to leaders' positive emotional expressions. In Study 3, leaders' positive emotional expressions were linked to mood states of simulated followers. Results suggest that mood contagion may be one of the psychological mechanisms by which charismatic leaders influence followers. In Study 4, we used a trained actor and manipulated leaders' positive emotional expressions to isolate the effects of positive emotions from the potential effects of non-emotional aspects of effective leadership (e.g., vision, other inspirational influence processes). A positive link between leader emotions and follower mood was found. Results also indicate that both leaders' positive emotional expressions and follower mood influenced ratings of leader effectiveness and attraction to the leader.",

      "abstractNote": "This study advanced knowledge on charisma by (a) introducing a new personality-based model to conceptualize and assess charisma and by (b) investigating curvilinear relationships between charismatic personality and leader effectiveness. Moreover, we delved deeper into this curvilinear association by (c) examining moderation by the leader’s level of adjustment and by (d) testing a process model through which the effects of charismatic personality on effectiveness are explained with a consideration of specific leader behaviors. Study 1 validated HDS charisma (Hogan Development Survey) as a useful trait-based measure of charisma. In Study 2 a sample of leaders (N ϭ 306) were assessed in the context of a 360-degree development center. In line with the too-much-of-a-good-thing effect, an inverted U-shaped relationship between charismatic personality and observer-rated leader effectiveness was found, indicating that moderate levels are better than low or high levels of charisma. Study 3 (N ϭ 287) replicated this curvilinear relationship and further illustrated the moderating role of leader adjustment, in such a way that the inflection point after which the effects of charisma turn negative occurs at higher levels of charisma when adjustment is high. Nonlinear mediation modeling further confirmed that strategic and operational leader behaviors fully mediate the curvilinear relationship. Leaders low on charisma are less effective because they lack strategic behavior; highly charismatic leaders are less effective because they lack operational behavior. In sum, this work provides insight into the dispositional nature of charisma and uncovers the processes through which and conditions under which leader charisma translates into (in)effectiveness.",

One issue that has been neglected is the disposition of the followers who form charismatic relationships with their leaders. To investigate this topic, we conducted a laboratory study in which participants' values and personality dimensions were used to predict participants' preferences for charismatic leadership vs. two other leadership styles: relationship-oriented and task-oriented leadership. The results showed that values and personality were useful in predicting leadership preferences. More research is needed to gain further insights into the active role of followers in the formation of charismatic relationships. D 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.",

      "abstractNote": "Under the increasing inﬂuence of trait-perspectives on leadership, the current study introduces a personality-based measure of charisma. In order to obtain a Five-Factor Model (FFM) prototype for the charismatic leader, experts in the ﬁeld of leadership and personality research were invited to participate in an expert panel. For each of the 30 NEO PI-R facets, experts (N = 38) rated the prototypic case of a successful charismatic leader on a scale ranging between 1 (extremely low) and 9 (extremely high). Based on the FFM count technique (Miller, Bagby, Pilkonis, Reynolds, & Lynam, 2005), an easy-to-use count was developed in which facets that were rated as being prototypically high (≥7) or low (≤3) were summed together to calculate the FFM charisma score. To investigate the predictive validity of the FFM charisma count in terms of work-related outcomes, the 1994 Ghent alumni sample was used in which college alumni (N = 262) were administered the NEO PI-R before entering the labor market and 15 years later when their professional careers had unfolded. The results demonstrate that FFM charisma was positively related to extrinsic career outcomes 15 years later, including income, number of subordinates, and managerial level. Moreover, FFM charisma was positively associated with adaptive performance, and with career roles that directly relate to charismatic leadership. It is concluded that the FFM charisma compound provides opportunities to map charismatic tendencies in a career-relevant way.",

Based on Gray's reinforcement sensitivity theory, we expected the relationships between approach‐oriented dispositions and charisma to diminish under conditions of high workload‐induced stress. In a large‐scale lab study with 201 groups (Study 1,\n              N\n              = 721 participants), we manipulated conditions of stress and tested the interaction of stress with leaders’ extraversion and openness to experience in predicting their charismatic behaviors. We then tested, in a field study of 71 executives (Study 2,\n              N\n              = 256 participants), the interaction of employees’ reported stress with leaders’ stimulation values in predicting their charismatic behavior. In support of our hypotheses, the relationships between approach‐oriented dispositions and charisma were significantly weaker when stress was high. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of this finding, in particular given that it is in stressful conditions under which charismatic leadership is said to be most important.",

      "abstractNote": "While early research on charismatic communication focused on charismatic language and more specifically rhetoric strategies, recent studies increasingly reveal the acoustic-prosodic features of charismatic speech. Furthermore, the development of the PASCAL score provided a complex metric which assesses the charisma level of a speaker’s acoustic voice profile. While this measurement of charismatic speech is attributional and hence assesses charisma through its impact on the listener, we may ask whether speakers whose voices are perceived as charismatic embody certain charismatic personality traits. We assessed the PASCAL charisma score as well as its individual acoustic features of 30 female speakers and correlated them with the Big Five personality traits. The results suggest that charismatic speech is not correlated with a charismatic personality, which supports the hypothesis that charismatic speech constitutes a skill that needs to be learned and is largely independent of personality. However, certain personality facets may facilitate speaker charisma and are correlated with acoustic features that make up charismatic speech. Specifically, assertiveness and activity correlate with a more charismatic f0 mean, articulation rate as well as phrase duration for female speakers, while facets such as anxiety, diligence and surprisingly gregariousness seem to be detrimental to speaker charisma.",

Does this social capital affect team performance because subordinates come to see the leader as charismatic? We answered this question by examining 2 models. First, we tested the charisma-to-centrality model according to which the leader’s charisma facilitates the occupation of a central position in the informal advice network. From this central position, the leader positively influences team performance. Second, we examined the centrality-to-charisma model according to which charisma is attributed to those leaders who are socially active in terms of giving and receiving advice. Attributed charisma facilitates increased team performance. We tested these 2 models in 2 different studies. In the first study, based on time-separated, multisource data emanating from members of 56 work teams, we found support for the centrality-to-charisma model. Formal leaders who were central within team advice networks were seen as charismatic by subordinates, and this charisma was associated with high team performance. To clarify how leader network centrality affected the emergence of charismatic leadership, we designed Study 2 in which, for 79 student teams, we measured leader networking activity and leader charisma at 2 different points in time and related these variables to team performance measured at a third point in time. On the basis of this temporally separated data set, we again found support for the centrality-to-charisma model.",

      "abstractNote": "Charismatic leadership is a critical construct that draws much attention from both academic and practitioner literatures. Despite the positive attention received by the charisma construct, some have criticized its conceptualization and measurement. These critiques have, in turn, cast doubt on what we know regarding the antecedents and outcomes of charismatic leadership. In this review, we adopt a recently developed deﬁnition of charismatic leadership and then conduct a meta-analysis of its antecedents and objective outcomes. Following an examination of 76 independent studies and 36,031 individuals, results indicate that the Big Five traits and cognitive ability vary in their association with charismatic leadership. Other ﬁndings show that dimensions of charismatic leadership predict outcomes of interest, such as supervisorrated task performance, supervisor-rated citizenship behaviors, and group or organization performance. Several shortcomings are identiﬁed, however, in testing theoretical and methodological moderating variables. The present research ultimately provides a roadmap for new frontiers in theoretical, measurement and empirical work on charismatic leadership.",

The authors hypothesized that leaders’ positive affect, positive expression, and aroused behavior will mediate these relationships. The results of their lab study suggest that leaders’ positive expression and aroused behavior mediated these relationships. A field study showed that firefighters under the command of a charismatic officer were happier than those under the command of a non-charismatic officer and that these relationships were mediated by the leader’s positive affect and a tendency to express positivity.",

      "abstractNote": "Charismatic leaders have consistently been shown to affect followers' performance, motivation, and satisfaction. Yet, what precisely constitutes charisma still remains somewhat enigmatic. So far, research has mainly focused on leader traits, leader behaviors, or the leader follower-relationship, and the subsequent consequences of each on followers' self-concepts. All of these approaches share the notion that leader charisma depends on an explicit interaction between leader and follower. With the present review paper, we extend extant theorizing by arguing that charisma is additionally informed by embodied signals that ﬂow directly from either the leader or the immediate environment. We introduce the embodiment perspective on human perception and describe its utility for theoretically understanding the charismatic effect. Correspondingly, we review studies that show which concrete embodied cues can support the charismatic effect. Finally, we discuss the variety of new theoretical and practical implications that arise from this research and how they can complement existing approaches to charismatic leadership.",

We analyzed two experiments on human-autonomy teams (HATs) operating a simulated remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) and correlated dynamical measures of resilience with measures of team performance. Across both experiments, HATs experienced automation and autonomy failures, using a Wizard of Oz paradigm. Team performance was measured in multiple ways, using a mission-level performance score, a target processing efficiency score, a failure overcome score, and a ground truth resilience score. Novel dynamical systems metrics of resilience measured the timing of system reorganization in response to failures across RPAS layers, including vehicle, controls, communications layers, and the system overall. Time to achieve extreme values of reorganization and novelty of reorganization were consistently correlated with target processing efficiency and ground truth resilience across both studies. Correlations with mission-level performance and the overcome score were apparent but less consistent. Across both studies, teams displayed greater system reorganization during failures compared to routine task conditions. The second experiment revealed differential effects of team training focused on coordination coaching and trust calibration. These results inform the measurement and training of resilience in HATs using objective, real-time resilience analysis.",

      "abstractNote": "Over two decades have passed since the publication of van Gelder's (1998) “dynamical hypothesis.” In that paper, van Gelder proposed that cognitive agents were not digital computers—per the representational computational approach—but dynamical systems. The evolution of the dynamical hypothesis was driven by parallel advances in three areas. Theoretically, a deeper understanding of genetics, biology, neuroscience, and cognitive science inspired questions about how systems within each domain dynamically interact and extend their effects across spatiotemporal scales. Methodologically, more sophisticated and domain-general tools allowed researchers to discover, model, and quantify system dynamics, structure, and patterns across multiple scales to generate a more comprehensive system-level understanding of behaviors. Empirically, we can analyze a system's behavior while preserving its natural dynamics, revealing evidence that the reductionist approach leads to an incomplete understanding of the components and the overall system. Researchers have traditionally reduced a complex system into its component processes and assumed that the parts can be recombined to explain the whole. These three advances fundamentally altered our understanding of a “cognitive agent:” How their behaviors are driven by long-range coordination across multiple processes, how the interdependent and nested structure of interacting variables produces behaviors that are greater than the sum of its parts, and how environmental constraints shape adaptive yet stable behavioral patterns.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper combines recent developments in theories of knowledge (complex dynamic systems), technologies (embodied interactions), and research tools (multimodal data collection and analysis) to offer new insights into how conceptual mathematical understanding can emerge. A complex dynamic system view models mathematics learning in terms of a multimodal agent who encounters a set of task constraints. The learning process in this context includes destabilizing a systemic configuration (for example, coordination of eye and hand movements) and forming new dynamic stability adapted to the task constraints. To test this model empirically, we applied a method developed to study complex systems, recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), to investigate students’ eye–hand dynamics during a touchscreen mathematics activity for the concept of proportionality. We found that across participants (n = 32), fluently coordinated hand-movement solutions coincided with more stable and predictable gaze patterns. We present a case study of a prototypical participant’s hand–eye RQA and audio–video data to show how the student’s cognitive system transitioned out of prior coordination reflective of additive thinking into a new coordination that can ground multiplicative thinking. These findings constitute empirical substantiation in mathematics education research for cognition as a complex system transitioning among dynamic equilibria.",

A stratified random sampling technique was used to assess the epistemological beliefs of 386 students at three universities in central Illinois. Confirming previous research, the results suggest that epistemological beliefs can be represented in terms of five factors: (a) certainty of knowledge, (b) omniscient authority, (c) orderly process, (d) innate ability, and (e) quick learning. Students who study in the \"soft\" fields (i.e., social science and arts/ humanities) have a stronger tendency to believe that knowledge is uncertain, are more reliant on their independent reasoning ability, and have a stronger feeling that learning is not an orderly process than students in \"hard\" fields (i.e., engineering and business). Graduate students showed a stronger tendency than undergraduate students to believe that knowledge is often uncertain, that learning is not usually an orderly process, and that knowledge is best acquired from independent reasoning. The results of this study suggest that students′ beliefs about learning are a product of the activity, the culture, and the context in which they are cultivated.",

We studied how high school students articulate scanning and deeper processing of information while answering questions using a Wikipedia® document and how their reading comprehension skills and the question type interact with these processes. By analyzing retrospective think-aloud protocols and eye-tracking measures, we found that scanning of information led to poor hypertext comprehension, while deep processing of information produced better performance, especially in location questions. This relationship between scanning, deep processing, and performance was qualified by reading comprehension skills in an unexpected way: scanning led to lower performance, especially for good comprehenders, while the positive effect of deep processing was independent of reading comprehension skills. We discussed the results in light of our current knowledge of Internet problem solving.",

These factors were task (argumentative vs. narrative), available text material (with vs. without primary sources), and presentation format (active vs. static). The study was conducted with the help of the combination of three tools (DEWEX, Chemnitz LogAnalyzer, and SummTool) developed for Web-based experimenting. The results show that the task is the most important factor for successful learning from multiple hypertexts. Depending on the task, the participants were either able or unable to apply adequate strategies, such as considering the source information. It was also observed that argumentative tasks were supported by an active hypertext presentation format, whereas performance on narrative tasks increased with a passive presentation format. No effect was shown for the type of texts available.",

      "abstractNote": "Understanding conflicts between sources is an inherent part of science text comprehension. We examined whether readers' memories for conflicts and their situational interpretation of conflicts would be affected by reading goals and lexical cue phrases that signal rhetorical relationships. To this end, 198 undergraduates read multiple documents on a medical controversy either with signals or without, following one of three reading goals (argument, summary, keyword list). Readers' memories for conflicting information were measured with a conflict verification task, and their situational interpretation of conflicts was analyzed from written essays. Results reveal that both argument and summary tasks as well as signaling facilitated verification of conflicts. In their essays, however, summary goal readers reported conflicts more often in a one-sided fashion. In contrast, argument goal readers and those who read texts with signals reported conflicts in a balanced fashion that included source information. Both theoretical and practical implications of the findings for reading about controversial scientific issues are discussed.",

Citations are important rhetorical devices that allow seasoned writers to promote their current research ﬁndings persuasively and efﬁciently. This paper reports the results of a case study on citation practices in 14 research papers written by non-native expert and novice writers who belong to the same discipline and work in a major research university in Malaysia. Different types and functions of citations found in the established scholars’ papers were compared to those of the novice academic writers within the same research ﬁeld. The ﬁndings indicated that types and functions of citations employed were different: novice writers mainly used citation to attribute while the experts used citations strategically to provide support and justify their claims. Novices mainly used citations in isolation whereas expert writers succinctly synthesized various sources and made greater use of non-integral citations. The results of the study could provide better understanding of the rhetorical functions of citations in academic writing and offer pedagogical opportunities for teaching academic writing to novice research writers.",

Choices made regarding what work to cite is a crucial aspect of the interpersonal dimension of academic texts, with the act of citing making visible a network of scholarly relations. Citation choices indicate, among other things, an author’s estimation of previous work in their ﬁeld, help to construct the author as a member of his or her disciplinary community, and provide an opportunity to promote his or her own work, or the work of colleagues. The paper draws on a 1.5 million word corpus of published psychology articles and uses quantitative and qualitative analysis to explore in particular the citation practices of scholars working in non-Anglophone contexts, but publishing their research in English. The aim of this paper is to foreground the signiﬁcance of the geolinguistic dimension to citation practices which is often backgrounded in studies of scholarly disciplinary community building.

      "abstractNote": "<p>Research has started to acknowledge the importance of emotions for complex learning and cognitive performance. However, research on epistemic emotions has only recently become more prominent. Research in educational psychology in particular has mostly focused on examining achievement emotions instead of epistemic emotions. Furthermore, only few studies have addressed functional mechanisms underlying multiple different epistemic emotions simultaneously, and only one study has systematically compared the origins and effects of epistemic emotions with other emotions relevant to knowledge generation (i.e., achievement emotions; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">Vogl et al., 2019</xref>). The present article aimed to replicate the findings from <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">Vogl et al. (2019)</xref> exploring within-person interrelations, origins, and outcomes of the epistemic emotions surprise, curiosity, and confusion, and the achievement emotions pride and shame, as well as to analyze their robustness and generalizability across two different study settings (online; Study 1, <italic>n</italic> = 169 vs. lab; Study 2, <italic>n</italic> = 79). In addition, the previous findings by <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">Vogl et al. (2019</xref>, Study 3) and the present two new studies were meta-analytically integrated to consolidate evidence on origins and outcomes of epistemic emotions. The results of the two new studies largely replicated the findings by <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">Vogl et al. (2019)</xref>. Combined with the meta-analytic results, the findings confirm distinct patterns of antecedents for epistemic vs. achievement emotions: Pride and shame were more strongly associated with the correctness of a person’s answer (i.e., accuracy), whereas surprise, curiosity, and confusion were more strongly related to incorrect responses a person was confident in (i.e., high-confidence errors) producing cognitive incongruity. Furthermore, in contrast to achievement emotions, epistemic emotions had positive effects on the exploration of knowledge. Implications for research and practice are discussed.</p>",

Modern research in metacognition assumes that monitoring of cognition plays a causal role in self-regulation of cognitive processes, making it imperative that monitoring of cognition is accurate. Accordingly, I describe research on metacognitive accuracy and several factors that reliably impact metacognitive accuracy. I conclude by discussing emerging issues and approaches to teaching metacognition.",

The intermediate level young participants included junior-high and senior-high school learners between the ages of 14 and 17. The high-intermediate adult participants were university students from the fields of social sciences, humanities, and languages. The results of the Pearson product moment correlation indicated that there was a moderate, positive, and significant correlation between strategy types and reading performances. The results of a one-way ANOVA showed that the preferences for the cognitive and metacognitive strategies differed across levels of education. The findings offer implications for the classroom suggesting that foreign language learning involves more than the acquisition of the target language, as learners’ develop cognitively, socially, and linguistically at the same time.",

Students participated in a 2-hour activity using our gStudy software to complete a course assignment. We used log file data to construct profiles of self-regulated learning activity in four ways: (a) frequency of studying events, (b) patterns of studying activity, (c) timing and sequencing of events, and (d) content analyses of students’ notes and summaries. Findings indicate that students’ self-reports may not calibrate to actual studying activity. Analyses of log file traces of studying activities provide important information for defining strategies and sequences of fine-grained studying actions. We contrast these analytic methods and illustrate how trace-based profiles of students’ self-regulated studying inform models of metacognitive monitoring, evaluation, and self-regulated adaptation.",

One hundred twenty university undergraduates completed a measure of misconceptions about genetically modified foods and were randomly assigned to study an expository or refutation text. After studying, participants reported their levels of surprise, curiosity, and confusion during learning, the extent to which they used self-reported critical thinking and elaboration strategies, and again completed the misconceptions measure. Individuals studying the refutation text experienced more surprise and changed more misconceptions to correct conceptions compared to participants studying the expository text. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that text type moderated the mediated relations between task value and surprise, curiosity, self-reported critical thinking and elaboration. Task value was positively related to surprise in the refutation condition but negatively related to surprise in the expository condition. Additionally, curiosity positively predicted self-reported critical thinking and elaboration strategies in the refutation condition but not in the expository condition. Results demonstrate that epistemic emotions play a significant role in conceptual change.",

We first review important tenets of personal epistemology and SRL and then present a model of SRL that situates personal epistemology within that model. We then define epistemic emotions, describe under what conditions epistemic emotions arise, and delineate how these emotions may facilitate or constrain learning processes and learning outcomes. Specifically, we present five antecedents to epistemic emotions and five consequences of those emotions during learning. The five antecedents are control, value, novelty, complexity, and achievement or impasses of epistemic aims. The five consequences are effects on planning and goal setting, motivation, cognitive and metacognitive strategies, learning outcomes, and revisions to antecedents. We end with a discussion of educational implications and future directions for research.",

We draw on examples of self-regulated learning from the science education literature to summarise and illustrate effective instructional methods and the development of metacognitive understanding (Gunstone; 1999a; Rickey & Stacy, 2000; White & Mitchell, 1994). We also focus on the crucial role that metacognition plays in self-regulation (Baird & White, 1996; Nichols, Tippins, & Wieseman, 1997; White, 1998).",

      "abstractNote": "Citations provide truncated yet socially complex information about sources in academic texts which students are obliged to read, comprehend, and then ultimately produce as part of an academic discourse community. While researchers have observed a developmental process whereby students produce citations during source-based writing, little work has investigated the reading stage when students visually encounter citations. In this study, we explored academic reading behaviors by examining eye movements of 27 graduate students and 18 professors as they read 6 authentic research texts for various purposes (summary, analysis, synthesis). Results of factorial ANOVAs showed no differences between students and professors but did reveal that both groups spent far less time looking at citations than surrounding text and that reading purposes affected citation reading behavior. These results indicate that students and professors read academic citations in similar ways. Further, the findings suggest that synthesizing sources, not just summarizing or analyzing them, results in greater attention to citations; thus, students developing their academic writing and citation skills may benefit from synthesizing multiple sources.",

      "abstractNote": "Affective facial expressions are potent social cues that can induce relevant physiological changes, as well as behavioral dispositions in the observer. Previous studies have revealed that angry faces induced significant reductions in body sway as compared with neutral and happy faces, reflecting an avoidance behavioral tendency as freezing. The expression of pain is usually considered an unpleasant stimulus, but also a relevant cue for delivering effective care and social support. Nevertheless, there are few data about behavioral dispositions elicited by the observation of pain expressions in others. The aim of the present research was to evaluate approach–avoidance tendencies by using video recordings of postural body sway when participants were standing and observing facial expressions of pain, happy and neutral. We hypothesized that although pain faces would be rated as more unpleasant than the other faces, they would provoke significant changes in postural body sway as compared to neutral facial expressions. Forty healthy female volunteers (mean age 25) participated in the study. Amplitude of forward movements and backward movements in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes were obtained. Statistical analyses revealed that pain faces were the most unpleasant stimuli, and that both happy and pain faces were more arousing than neutral ones. Happy and pain faces also elicited greater amplitude of body sway in the anterior-posterior axes as compared with neutral faces. In addition, significant positive correlations were found between body sway elicited by pain faces and pleasantness and empathic ratings, suggesting that changes in postural body sway elicited by pain faces might be associated with approach and cooperative behavioral responses.",

      "abstractNote": "One of the primary ways researchers have characterized engagement during information search is by increases in search behaviors, such as queries and clicks. However, studies have shown that frustration is also characterized by increases in these same behaviors. This research examines the differences in the search behaviors and physiologies of people who are engaged or frustrated during search. A 2x2 within-subject laboratory experiment was conducted with 40 participants. Engagement was induced by manipulating task interest and frustration was induced by manipulating the quality of the search results. Participants' interactions and physiological responses were recorded, and after they searched, they evaluated their levels of engagement, frustration and stress. Participants reported significantly greater levels of engagement when completing tasks that interested them and significantly less engagement during searches with poor results quality. For all search behaviors measured, only two significant differences were found according to task interest: participants had more scrolls and longer query intervals when searching for interesting tasks, suggesting greater interaction with content. Significant differences were found for nine behaviors according to results quality, including queries issued, number of SERPs displayed and number of SERP clicks, suggesting these are potentially better indicators of frustration rather than engagement. When presented with poor quality results, participants had significantly higher heart rates than when presented with normal quality results. Finally, participants had lower heart rates and greater skin conductance responses when conducting interesting tasks than when conducting uninteresting tasks. This research provides insight into the differences in search behaviors and physiologies of participants when they are engaged versus frustrated and presents techniques that can be used by those wishing to induce engagement and frustration during laboratory IIR studies.",

Videos of the participants’ faces were captured while they interacted with AutoTutor on computer literacy topics. After the tutoring session, the affective states (boredom, confusion, delight, flow, frustration, and surprise) of the student were identified by the learner, a peer, and two trained judges. Participants’ facial expressions were coded by two independent judges using Ekman’s Facial Action Coding System. Correlational analyses indicated that specific facial features could segregate confusion, delight, and frustration form the baseline state of neutral, but boredom was indistinguishable from neutral. We discuss the prospects of automatically detecting these emotions on the basis of facial features that are highly diagnostic.",

      "abstractNote": "We developed and evaluated a multimodal affect detector that combines conversational cues, gross body language, and facial features. The multimodal affect detector uses feature-level fusion to combine the sensory channels and linear discriminant analyses to discriminate between naturally occurring experiences of boredom, engagement/flow, confusion, frustration, delight, and neutral. Training and validation data for the affect detector were collected in a study where 28 learners completed a 32- min. tutorial session with AutoTutor, an intelligent tutoring system with conversational dialogue. Classification results supported a channel × judgment type interaction, where the face was the most diagnostic channel for spontaneous affect judgments (i.e., at any time in the tutorial session), while conversational cues were superior for fixed judgments (i.e., every 20 s in the session). The analyses also indicated that the accuracy of the multichannel model (face, dialogue, and posture) was statistically higher than the best single-channel model for the fixed but not spontaneous affect expressions. However, multichannel models reduced the discrepancy (i.e., variance in the precision of the different emotions) of the discriminant models for both judgment types. The results also indicated that the combination of channels yielded superadditive effects for some affective states, but additive, redundant, and inhibitory effects for others. We explore the structure of the multimodal linear discriminant models and discuss the implications of some of our major findings.",

      "abstractNote": "In very young children, immature control of posture and gait results in unsteady locomotion. In children of ∼3 yr of age, gait appears relatively mature; however, it is unknown whether the dynamics of walking change beyond this age. Because stride dynamics depend on neural control, we hypothesized that motor control would continue to develop beyond age 3. To test this hypothesis, we measured the gait cycle duration on a stride-by-stride basis in 50 healthy 3- to 14-yr-old children (25 girls). Measurements of stride-to-stride variability were significantly larger both in the 3- and 4-yr-old children, compared with the 6- and 7-yr-old children, and in the 6- and 7-yr-old children, compared with the 11- to 14-yr-old children. Measurements of the temporal organization of gait also revealed significant age-dependent changes. The effects of age persisted even after adjusting for height. These findings indicate that mature stride dynamics may not be completely developed even in healthy 7-yr-old children and that different aspects of stride dynamics mature at different ages.",

The availability of vision and visuo-spatial cognitive load were manipulated. Postural sway patterns were analyzed using recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), which revealed differences in center of pressure (COP) dynamics between Parkinson's and control participants. AP COP trajectories for the Parkinson's group were not only significantly more variable than for the control group, but also exhibited distinct patterns of temporal dynamics. The visual manipulation did not differentially affect the two groups. No cognitive load effects were found. The results are generally consistent with the hypothesis that pathological physiological systems exhibit a tendency for less flexible, more deterministic dynamic patterns.",

Based on an embodied cognition perspective, the\nauthors predicted that kinesthetic imagery would lead to activations in\nmovement-relevant motor systems to a greater degree than visual imagery. This\nprediction was tested among 30 participants who imagined various motor\nactivities from different visual perspectives while standing on a strain gauge\nplate. The results showed that kinesthetic imagery of lower body movements, but\nnot of upper body movements, had clear effects on postural parameters (sway path\nlength and frequency contents of sway). Visual imagery, in contrast, had no\nreliable effects on postural activity. We also found that postural effects were\nnot affected by the vividness of imagery. The results suggest that during\nkinesthetic motor imagery participants partially simulated (re-activated) the\nimagined movements, leading to unintentional postural adjustments. These\nfindings are consistent with an embodied cognition perspective on motor\nimagery.",

      "abstractNote": "How does language comprehension interact with motor activity? We investigated the conditions under which comprehending an action sentence affects people's balance. We performed two experiments to assess whether sentences describing forward or backward movement modulate the lateral movements made by subjects who made sensibility judgments about the sentences. In one experiment subjects were standing on a balance board and in the other they were seated on a balance board that was mounted on a chair. This allowed us to investigate whether the action compatibility effect (ACE) is robust and persists in the face of salient incompatibilities between sentence content and subject movement. Growth-curve analysis of the movement trajectories produced by the subjects in response to the sentences suggests that the ACE is indeed robust. Sentence content influenced movement trajectory despite salient inconsistencies between implied and actual movement. These results are interpreted in the context of the current discussion of embodied, or grounded, language comprehension and meaning representation.",

Although cognitive and locomotor performances are known to interact when performed concurrently, it is not known whether concurrent performance affects the tasks’ pink noise dynamical structure. In this study, participants performed a cognitive task (repeatedly producing a temporal interval) and a motor task (walking on a treadmill) in single- and dual-task conditions. In single-task conditions both tasks exhibited pink noise structure. For concurrent performance the dynamical structure of the cognitive task changed reliably in the direction of white (random) noise. The dynamical structure of locomotion remained pink noise. The change in cognitive dynamics occurred despite no reliable changes in mean or standard deviation measures for either task. The results suggest a functional reorganization of cognitive dynamics supporting successful task performance in dual-task conditions.",

The aim was to examine the role of syntactic awareness (children’s awareness of the syntactic structure of sentences and their ability to reflect on and manipulate that structure) as a potential source of reading fluency and comprehension difficulty for these readers. We found that the students’ levels of syntactic awareness were significantly related to their reading fluency (r= .625) and reading comprehension performance (r= .816). These relationships indicate that lower levels of syntactic awareness correspond to poor reading fluency and poor comprehension among these readers. These findings have important implications for research and instruction addressing the relative contributions of broader language skills to the development of reading fluency and comprehension among struggling readers.",

After a learning session with an intelligent tutoring system with conversational dialogue, the cognitive-affective states of the learner were classified by the learner, a peer, and two trained judges at approximately 100 points in the tutorial session. Decay rates for the cognitive-affective states were estimated by fitting exponential curves to time series of affect responses. The results partially confirmed predictions of goal-appraisal theories of emotion by supporting a tripartite classification of the states along a temporal dimension: persistent states (boredom, engagement/flow, and confusion), transitory states (delight and surprise), and an intermediate state (frustration). Patterns of decay rates were generally consistent across affect judges, except that a reversed actor-observer effect was discovered for engagement/flow and frustration. Correlations between decay rates of the cognitive-affective states and several learning measures confirmed the major predictions and uncovered some novel findings that have implications for theories of pedagogy that integrate cognition and affect during deep learning.",

Such accounts, I argue, are temporally austere or impoverished, and are consequently unable to make sense of the diachronic and dynamic character of constitution in dynamical systems generally and dynamically extended cognitive processes in particular. In this paper, my target domain is extended cognition based on insights from nonlinear dynamics. Contrariwise to the mainstream literature in both analytical metaphysics and extended cognition, I develop a nonstandard, alternative conception of constitution, which I call “diachronic process constitution”. It will be argued that only a diachronic and dynamical conception of constitution is consistent with the nature of constitution in distributed cognitive processes.",

Seventy-nine elementary students from the ﬁfth grade participated. Students self-reported their perceptions of control and value speciﬁc to mathematics problem solving, and were given a complex mathematics problem to solve over a period of several days. At speciﬁc time intervals during problem solving, students reported their epistemic and activity emotions. To capture self-regulatory processes, students thought out loud as they solved the problem. Path analyses revealed that both perceived control and value served as important antecedents to the epistemic and activity emotions students experienced during problem solving. Epistemic and activity emotions also predicted the types of processing strategies students used across three phases of selfregulated learning during problem solving. Finally, shallow and deep processing cognitive and metacognitive strategies positively predicted problem-solving performance. Theoretical and educational implications are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Human experience is inherently temporal and involves placing events, symbols, and actions in a temporal scheme. This article deals with a specific aspect of temporal experience as it relates to reading and experiencing narrative fiction. Within an enactive understanding of human cognition, we propose a view of literary reading as a process of participatory sense-making between a reader and a storyteller. The enactive theory of participatory sense-making maintains that agents, by enacting their own sense-making, directly and partially constitute the sense-making of other agents. Sense-makers in interaction navigate two orders of normativity: their own and that of the interaction itself. Linguistic sense-making (languaging) opens up further possibilities for understanding complex spatially and temporally distributed forms of social interactions such as narrative interactions. Reading a narrative is one such example of mutually constituted navigation between an interaction dynamic and interactors’ sense-making. The reader completes and co-authors emergent textual meaning and a textually emerging storyteller guides and anticipates the multiple temporal displacements, realized linguistically, that a reader has to experience in the process of reading. We explore the participatory structure of a narrative through its temporal unfolding and the specific, non-linear nature of the temporal dynamics of interacting with a storytelling agency. In particular, narrative interactions are seen as modulations in the pacing of a given narrative’s unfolding. It is suggested that the reader’s enactment of such temporally realized pacings constitutes a better description of narrative immersion than its traditional understanding as a simulation of spatial situatedness.",

      "abstractNote": "Nonlinear methods of fractal analysis and recurrence quantification analysis are becoming more commonplace in the cognitive and behavioral sciences. These methods are illustrated here in a tutorial style using self-paced reading data. Self-paced reading was performed in which each spacebar press revealed a story word-by-word or else sentence-by-sentence. Participant readers were either Ph.D. candidates in English literature or undergraduates from an introductory psychology course and the same story was read by all, either one time only or reread another time on another occasion. The nonlinear analyses revealed crucial differences between the word unit and sentence unit conditions. Performance in the word unit condition was dominated by a task specific strategy, yielding data patterns more like those observed in tapping tasks. Nonlinear analyses of the sentence unit condition, however, discriminated between graduate and undergraduate readers, and first readings of the story from re-reading. From these analyses, the repeated reading of the same story reveals a kind of über-fluency, in a manner of speaking, of the Ph.D. candidates in English literature, whose performance stayed at or closer to a performance ceiling in both readings.",

      "abstractNote": "Reading competence is one of the main gateways to learning and serves as the foundation for nearly all academic subjects, but reading is not a natural skill. For beginning and struggling readers, the process of learning to read is often fraught with frustration. Thus, abilities to manage affect or emotions and maintain attention or focus (i.e., emotional self-regulation processes) are critical for literacy development and reading competence. Building on bio-social-ecological systems (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006) and contextual-developmental (Chen & Schmidt, 2015) frameworks, we present a contextual-developmental model of reading competence to integrate multidisciplinary empirical research on the fit between children’s emotional self-regulation processes and their literacy contexts and how these dynamical cognitive-emotional-motivational processes influence motivation, engagement, and competence in reading. We present empirical research in support of our model, and call for increased multidisciplinary research that takes into consideration children’s literacy contexts and their neurobiological and behavioral assets and vulnerabilities in order to better understand the complex pathways that underlie the development of reading competence from early childhood through adolescence and emerging adulthood, as well as the timing and points of entry for optimal impact for reading interventions.",

Using Structural Equation Modeling, this study examined the measurement and structural relations of the rate and accuracy of variables important in early reading: phonemic blending, letter sounds, phonograms, decoding, single-word reading, reading comprehension, and text reading as well as reading comprehension among second grade readers. The effects from phonemic blending fluency and letter sound fluency to decoding were completely mediated by phonogram fluency, decoding fluency, single-word reading fluency, and reading comprehension had direct effects on the text reading fluency of the second grade students. Understanding the relationship among the many component skills of readers early in their reading development is important because a deficiency in any of the component skills has the potential to affect the development of other skills and, ultimately, the development of the child as a proficient reader.",

We examined (1) developmentally changing relations among word reading fluency, listening comprehension, text reading fluency, and reading comprehension; (2) the relation of reading comprehension to text reading fluency; (3) unique emergent literacy predictors (i.e., phonological awareness, orthographic awareness, morphological awareness, letter name knowledge, vocabulary) of text reading fluency vs. word reading fluency; and (4) unique language and cognitive predictors (e.g., vocabulary, grammatical knowledge, theory of mind) of text reading fluency vs. reading comprehension. These questions were addressed using longitudinal data (two timepoints; Mean age = 5;24 & 6;08) from Korean-speaking children (N = 143). Results showed that listening comprehension was related to text reading fluency at time 2, but not at time 1. At both times text reading fluency was related to reading comprehension, and reading comprehension was related to text reading fluency over and above word reading fluency and listening comprehension. Orthographic awareness was related to text reading fluency over and above other emergent literacy skills and word reading fluency. Vocabulary and grammatical knowledge were independently related to text reading fluency and reading comprehension whereas theory of mind was related to reading comprehension, but not text reading fluency. These results reveal developmental nature of relations and mechanism of text reading fluency in reading development.",

Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that reading fluency at each level related uniquely to performance on a standardized reading comprehension test in a model including inferencing skill and background knowledge. The study supports an automaticity effect for word recognition speed and an automaticity-like effect related to syntactic processing skill. In addition, hierarchical regressions using longitudinal data suggest that fluency and reading comprehension have a bidirectional relationship. The discussion emphasizes the theoretical expansion of reading fluency to 3 levels of cognitive processes and the relations of these processes to reading comprehension.",

      "abstractNote": "<p>The most exciting hypothesis in cognitive science right now is the theory that cognition is embodied. Like all good ideas in cognitive science, however, embodiment immediately came to mean six different things. The most common definitions involve the straight-forward claim that “states of the body modify states of the mind.” However, the implications of embodiment are actually much more radical than this. If cognition can span the brain, body, and the environment, then the “states of mind” of disembodied cognitive science won’t exist to be modified. Cognition will instead be an extended system assembled from a broad array of resources. Taking embodiment seriously therefore requires both new methods and theory. Here we outline four key steps that research programs should follow in order to fully engage with the implications of embodiment. The first step is to conduct a task analysis, which characterizes from a first person perspective the specific task that a perceiving-acting cognitive agent is faced with. The second step is to identify the task-relevant resources the agent has access to in order to solve the task. These resources can span brain, body, and environment. The third step is to identify how the agent can assemble these resources into a system capable of solving the problem at hand. The last step is to test the agent’s performance to confirm that agent is actually using the solution identified in step 3. We explore these steps in more detail with reference to two useful examples (the outfielder problem and the A-not-B error), and introduce how to apply this analysis to the thorny question of language use. Embodied cognition is more than we think it is, and we have the tools we need to realize its full potential.</p>",

      "abstractNote": "This paper briefly introduces radical embodied cognitive science (RECS) and places it in historical perspective. Radical embodied cognitive science is an interdisciplinary approach to psychology that combines ideas from the phenomenological tradition with ecological psychology and dynamical systems modeling. It is argued that radical embodied cognitive science has a long history; it is as a direct descendent of the Jamesian functionalist approach to psychology. This approach to psychology is contrasted with the current trend of supplementing standard cognitive psychology with occasional references to the body. In contrast with these trends, radical embodied cognitive science is skeptical of the explanatory usefulness of mental representations. The future prospects of radical embodied cognitive science and the broader functionalist framework are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "The prospect of speed reading—reading at an increased speed without any loss of comprehension—has undeniable appeal. Speed reading has been an intriguing concept for decades, at least since Evelyn Wood introduced her Reading Dynamics training program in 1959. It has recently increased in popularity, with speed-reading apps and technologies being introduced for smartphones and digital devices. The current article reviews what the scientific community knows about the reading process—a great deal—and discusses the implications of the research findings for potential students of speed-reading training programs or purchasers of speed-reading apps. The research shows that there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. It is unlikely that readers will be able to double or triple their reading speeds (e.g., from around 250 to 500–750 words per minute) while still being able to understand the text as well as if they read at normal speed. If a thorough understanding of the text is not the reader’s goal, then speed reading or skimming the text will allow the reader to get through it faster with moderate comprehension. The way to maintain high comprehension and get through text faster is to practice reading and to become a more skilled language user (e.g., through increased vocabulary). This is because language skill is at the heart of reading speed.",

      "abstractNote": "In the last decade, reading research has seen a paradigmatic shift. A new wave of computational models of orthographic processing that offer various forms of noisy position or context-sensitive coding, have revolutionized the field of visual word recognition. The influx of such models stems mainly from consistent findings, coming mostly from European languages, regarding an apparent insensitivity of skilled readers to letter-order. Underlying the current revolution is the theoretical assumption that the insensitivity of readers to letter order reflects the special way in which the human brain encodes the position of letters in printed words. The present paper discusses the theoretical shortcomings and misconceptions of this approach to visual word recognition. A systematic review of data obtained from a variety of languages demonstrates that letter-order insensitivity is not a general property of the cognitive system, neither it is a property of the brain in encoding letters. Rather, it is a variant and idiosyncratic characteristic of some languages, mostly European, reflecting a strategy of optimizing encoding resources, given the specific structure of words. Since the main goal of reading research is to develop theories that describe the fundamental and invariant phenomena of reading across orthographies, an alternative approach to model visual word recognition is offered. The dimensions of a possible universal model of reading, which outlines the common cognitive operations involved in orthographic processing in all writing systems, are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "The present chapter is a brief introduction to research on eye movements during reading. In the chapter, we will describe what the eye movement methodology has revealed about word recognition, syntactic parsing of sentences, and comprehension of longer segments of text. The typical eye movement pattern in reading is one where the reader makes a sequence of left to right eye movements from one word to the next so that most words are fixated at least once. Words that typically do not receive a fixation are short, high-frequency function words, such as articles and prepositions. Fixation time spent on individual words and larger text units can then be used to tap into the cognitive processes that make reading possible. A wealth of data has been accumulated on using fixation time measures to investigate word recognition processes during reading. These studies have shown that fixation times reliably reflect the underlying mental processes ongoing during fixations on words. It has been shown, among other things, that orthographic, phonological and semantic features all influence the time spent fixating a word. This also applies to developing readers, who differ from mature readers in making more and longer fixations, shorter saccades and more regressions. The differences in eye movement patterns between developing and mature readers are primarily explained by lexical processing efficiency, not by low-level oculomotor factors. Eye movements have also been used to study processing of non-foveal text information. This is referred to as parafoveal word processing. Here the interesting questions are how far to the periphery useful information can be extracted and what kind of information can be gleaned from words around the fixated word. It has been found that the readers’ perceptual span is strongly biased toward the reading direction, that is, to the right when reading from left to right. Developing readers have smaller perceptual span than proficient readers. Adult readers extract parafoveally visual, orthographic and phonological information from the word to the right of the fixated word. Recent evidence suggests that they are also capable of extracting parafoveally semantic information concerning word meanings. Developmental studies of parafoveal word processing are just beginning to accrue. In the study of sentence parsing, that is, assigning a syntactic structure to a sentence, eye-tracking has become the gold standard. Having reliable and sensitive measures of the timing of effects is pertinent in testing predictions derived from different competing theories of sentence parsing. That sentences (and clauses) are regarded as processing units is demonstrated by the sentence wrap-up effect. Readers pause for longer time at sentence-final words before proceeding to the next sentence, presumably in order to integrate the words into a coherent sentence meaning. Eye movement studies of sentence parsing have demonstrated that parsing takes place incrementally as readers proceed through the sentence. Syntactic ambiguity, syntactic complexity and syntactic violations, among other things, have been shown to influence the eye movement patterns during sentence comprehension. Reading texts longer than single sentences has been the least researched area in the study of eye movements during reading. However, with the help of eye fixation measures developed to study global text processing, eye movement studies on text comprehension have recently been gaining increased popularity. To date, eye fixation patterns have been used to study how readers construct and update a mental representation of the text contents. For example, studies have been conducted on how readers solve inconsistencies in text and comprehend ironic statements. Moreover, research has shown that the reading goal has pervasive effects on eye movements during reading. Among other things, readers make more and longer fixations when reading text segments relevant to their reading goal. Also developing readers are capable of using a reading goal to adjust their intake of text information as they proceed through the text.",

Dutch participants stood upright on a force plate, measuring\nthe body center of pressure, while reading a succession of sentences. High\nphysical effort sentences resulted in more postural sway (greater\nSD) than low physical effort sentences. This effect only\nshowed up in medio-lateral sway but not anterio-posterior sway. This suggests\nthat sentence comprehension was accompanied by subtle motoric activity, likely\nmirroring the various activities symbolized in the sentences. We conclude that\nsemantic processing reaches the motor periphery, leading to increased postural\nactivity.",

Such results have been interpreted as indicating that concepts, and important aspects of cognition more broadly, are embodied. That conclusion does not follow from the empirical evidence. The reason why is that the empirical evidence can equally be accommodated by a ‘disembodied’ view of conceptual representation that makes explicit assumptions about spreading activation between the conceptual and sensory and motor systems. At the same time, the strong form of the embodied cognition hypothesis is at variance with currently available neuropsychological evidence. We suggest a middle ground between the embodied and disembodied cognition hypotheses – grounding by interaction. This hypothesis combines the view that concepts are, at some level, ‘abstract’ and ‘symbolic’, with the idea that sensory and motor information may ‘instantiate’ online conceptual processing.",

      ],
      "abstractNote": "This thesis investigates the potential for using standing balance as a way to measure changes in cognitive load during language processing. Changes in standing balance are measured as subjects process vocabulary words, sentences, and paragraphs with varying degrees of relative difficulty. It is predicted that the more difficult the content, the more subjects will sway.\nAlthough standing itself is a common enough task, the biological requirements of postural control during standing are fairly complex, requiring the involvement of an uninterrupted flow of afferent signals reaching the central nervous system from the muscle, tendon and joint proprioceptors, skin exteroceptors, and vestibular and visual inputs ([Fitzpatrick and McCloskey, 1994]). As such, there are numerous clinical applications in assessing standing balance, as decreasingly stable measured parameters from a standing posture can reflect the increased risk of falls in the elderly ([Maki et al., 1994]), individuals with Parkinson’s Disease ([Błaszczyk et al., 2007]), or patients with multiple sclerosis ([Prosperini and Pozzilli, 2013]). Standing balance is sensitive to psychological perturbations ([Kerr et al., 1985]), and may even be perturbed by language tasks ([Shumway-Cook et al., 1997]), indicating a link between standing and language processing.\nBased on prior literature, this thesis tests the assumption that there is a link between language processing and postural control. If standing control processes are interrupted by the processing of language, then using balance to measure changes in cognitive load could be used to objectively assess linguistic difficulty.\nForce plates are used to measure balance, which are laboratory-grade devices used in Biomechanics and Kinesiology to quantify various physical properties of human movement ([Winter, 2009]), ranging from running or jumping ([Chappell et al., 2005], [McLean et al., 2004]), to the more obscure and less conscious overall motions such as the subtle displacements involved in maintaining a standing upright posture ([Murray et al., 1975]).\nA set of experiments was performed on the auditory processing of three general elements of language: Paragraphs, sentences, and vocabulary words. There are two methods of analysis used, one which tests the overall changes in postural sway, and one which observes changes in postural sway over time. The two parameters used, respectively, are the fiftieth percentile of the radial range of the center of pressure, and the radial distance of the center of pressure over time.\nThe results from the overall changes in postural sway suggest that balance is sensitive to changes in cognitive load due to language processing. For the paragraphs, results suggest that very difficult passages elicit greater changes in postural sway compared to the easier passages. Likewise, in the first of two experiments on sentences, sentences which the literature reports requiring relatively more cognitive load to process exhibit relatively greater changes in postural sway. For the second sentence study, results suggest a correlation between postural sway and the acceptability rankings of four different sentence types, so long as syllable count is accounted for. For the experiment on vocabulary words, increases in postural sway are observed when the difficulty level is increased.\nThe results from the observations of postural sway over time also suggest that balance is sensitive to changes in cognitive load due to language processing. For the paragraphs, the trends of postural sway are different for each of the three difficulty levels tested. For the first of two experiments on sentences, it is shown that the sway is increased in the parts of the sentences where more cognitive load is required. Likewise for the second sentence study, a similar trend in postural sway is found for the regions of time where the sentences should be less acceptable. For vocabulary words, an observable trend is also present, and only a trend exists, implying that a threshold for utilizing postural sway to intuitively measure changes in cognitive load due to language processing is reached in vocabulary words.\nOverall, the results suggest that postural sway is sensitive to changes in cognitive load for paragraphs, sentences, and possibly vocabulary words. An intuitive interpretation of the results can be found for the studies on paragraphs and sentences, where greater amounts of sway is indicative of greater difficulty encountered during language processing. This trend in the data is present, but less apparent, for the study on the vocabulary words, providing some insight into how small the tested elements of language can be in getting an intuitive interpretation of changes in postural sway as it relates to changes in cognitive load during language processing. These results suggest that postural sway can be used as a practical tool for measuring changes in cognitive load during language processing.",

      "abstractNote": "Research has demonstrated that physical activity involving gross motor activities can lead to better cognitive functioning and higher academic achievement scores. In addition, research within the theoretical framework of embodied cognition has shown that embodying knowledge through the use of more subtle motor activities, such as task-relevant gestures, has a positive effect on learning. In this study, we investigated whether combining both physical activities and gestures could improve learning even more in a 4-week intervention program on foreign language vocabulary learning in preschool children. The main hypothesis that learning by embodying words through task-relevant enactment gestures and physical activities would be perceived as the preferred teaching method and lead to higher learning outcomes than learning by embodying words through task-relevant enactment gestures only, and learning without physical activities or gestures was confirmed by the results. The results of this study hold great promise for instructional methods combining physical activities and gestures as enhancers of children’s learning.",

      "abstractNote": "Traditional views in philosophy of mind and cognitive science depict the mind as an information processor, one whose connections with the body and the world are of little theoretical importance. On the contrary, mounting empirical evidence shows that bodily states and modality-specific systems for perception and action underlie information processing, and that embodiment contributes to various aspects and effects of mental phenomena. This article will briefly review and discuss some of this evidence and what it implies. By challenging mainstream accounts of mind and cognition, embodiment views offer new ways of conceptualizing knowledge and suggest novel perspectives on cognitive variation and mind-body reductionism.

      "abstractNote": "<p>The classic mapping metaphor posits that children learn a word by mapping it onto a concept of an object or event. However, we believe that a mapping metaphor cannot account for word learning, because even though children focus attention on objects, they do not necessarily remember the connection between the word and the referent unless it is framed pragmatically, that is, within a task. Our theoretical paper proposes an alternative mechanism for word learning. Our main premise is that word learning occurs as children accomplish a goal in cooperation with a partner. We follow <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">Bruner’s (1983)</xref> idea and further specify pragmatic frames as the learning units that drive language acquisition and cognitive development. These units consist of a sequence of actions and verbal behaviors that are co-constructed with a partner to achieve a joint goal. We elaborate on this alternative, offer some initial parametrizations of the concept, and embed it in current language learning approaches.</p>",

We investigate whether grounding actions inﬂuence reasoning, and how pedagogical language inﬂuences the actionecognition relationship. Undergraduate students (N ¼ 120) generated proofs for two mathematical tasks after performing either grounding or non-grounding actions. Grounding actions facilitated key mathematical insights for both tasks, but did not lead to superior proofs. Pedagogical language in the form of prompts (prospective statements) and hints (retrospective statements) accompanying grounding actions enhanced proof performance on one task but not the other. Results from transfer tasks suggested that participants learned to apply their mathematical insights to new contexts. The ﬁndings suggest that relations between action and cognition are reciprocal: actions facilitate insight, while pedagogical language strengthens the inﬂuence of task-relevant actions for proof production. Pedagogically supported grounding actions offer alternative ways of fostering mathematical reasoning.",

We asked adults and children to remember a list of letters or words while explaining how they solved a math problem. Both groups remembered significantly more items when they gestured during their math explanations than when they did not gesture. Gesturing appeared to save the speakers' cognitive resources on the explanation task, permitting the speakers to allocate more resources to the memory task. It is widely accepted that gesturing reflects a speaker's cognitive state, but our observations suggest that, by reducing cognitive load, gesturing may also play a role in shaping that state.",

      "abstractNote": "Ecological psychology isn't just a psychology of perception and action but offers a post-cognitivist approach to psychology as a whole. In this paper we explore how the conceptual tools of ecological psychology might be put to work to account for linguistic deeds, the activities people can perform when they are competent speakers of a language. We pursue this question by starting from a suggestion Gibson made that language use and perception co-shape each other. However such a relation of reciprocity between active perception and linguistic practices has generally not been taken to heart in ecological psychology. The relation between first-hand perception, based on natural laws, and second-hand perception, enabled by social and cultural convention, has been understood hierarchically not reciprocally. We show there is a trace of a traditional (cognitivist) view of language in how Gibson characterised what people do when they talk to each other. A second obstacle to a reciprocal reading lies in Gibson's concept of information. Gibson argued explicitly against thinking of ecological information for perception as a quantity that can be transmitted. However, when it comes to language he treated information as a commodity, as something that can be re-presented, contained and transferred through conventional patterns, through speaking, writing and depiction. In order to move away from a traditional cognitivist picture of language as mediated by systems of representations, we offer an alternative usage-based view of information, one where information is not a thing that can be re-presented, in language or anywhere else. This allows us to fully set aside the assumption that language is re-presentational and symbolic at heart and follow through on the post-cognitivist ambitions of ecological psychology.",

      "abstractNote": "Explaining emergent structure remains a challenge for all areas of cognitive science, and problem solving is no exception. The modern study of insight has drawn attention to the issue of emergent cognitive structure in problem solving research. We propose that the explanation of insight is beyond the scope of conventional approaches to cognitive science in terms of symbolic representation. Cognition may be better described in terms of an open, nonlinear dynamical system. By this reasoning, insight would be the self-organization of novel structure. Self-organization is a well-studied phenomenon of dynamical systems theory, associated with specific trends in entropy and power-law behavior. We present work using nonlinear dynamics to capture these trends in entropy and power-law behavior and thus to predict the self-organization of novel cognitive structure in a problem-solving task. Future explorations of problem solving will benefit from considerations of the continuous nonlinear interactions among action, cognition, and the environment.",

      "abstractNote": "The dominant assumption about the causal architecture of the mind is, that it is composed of a stable set of components that contribute independently to relevant observables that are employed to measure cognitive activity. This view has been called component-dominant dynamics. An alternative has been proposed, according to which the different components are not independent, but fundamentally interdependent, and are not stable basic properties of the mind, but rather an emergent feature of the mind given a particular task context. This view has been called interaction-dominant dynamics. In this paper, we review evidence for interaction-dominant dynamics as the causal architecture of the mind. We point out, that such an architecture is consistent with problems of convergence in research on the level of results and theorizing. Moreover, we point out that if interaction-dominant dynamics as the causal architecture of the mind were to be true, this would naturally lead to (some degree of) problems with generalization and replicability in sciences of the mind and brain, and would probably warrant changes in the scientific practice with regard to study-design and data analysis.",

      "abstractNote": "<p>This article aims to show that there is an alternative way to explain human action with respect to the bottlenecks of the psychology of decision making. The empirical study of human behaviour from mid-20th century to date has mainly developed by looking at a normative model of decision making. In particular Subjective Expected Utility (SEU) decision making, which stems from the subjective expected utility theory of <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref59\">Savage (1954)</xref> that itself extended the analysis by <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref70\">Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944)</xref>. On this view, the cognitive psychology of decision making precisely reflects the conceptual structure of formal decision theory. This article shows that there is an alternative way to understand decision making by recovering Newell and Simon’s account of problem solving, developed in the framework of bounded rationality, and inserting it into the more recent research program of embodied cognition. Herbert Simon emphasized the importance of problem solving and differentiated it from decision making, which he considered a phase downstream of the former. Moreover according to Simon the centre of gravity of the rationality of the action lies in the ability to adapt. And the centre of gravity of adaptation is not so much in the internal environment of the actor as in the pragmatic external environment. The behaviour adapts to external purposes and reveals those characteristics of the system that limit its adaptation. According to <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref61\">Simon (1981)</xref>, in fact, environmental feedback is the most effective factor in modelling human actions in solving a problem. In addition, his notion of <italic>problem space</italic> signifies the possible situations to be searched in order to find that situation which corresponds to the solution. Using the language of embodied cognition, the notion of problem space is about the possible solutions that are enacted in relation to environmental affordances. The correspondence between action and the solution of a problem conceptually bypasses the analytic phase of the decision and limits the role of symbolic representation. In solving any problem, the search for the solution corresponds to acting in ways that involve recursive feedback processes leading up to the final action. From this point of view, the new term <italic>enactive problem solving</italic> summarizes this fusion between bounded and embodied cognition. That problem solving involves bounded cognition means that it is through the problem solver’s enactive interaction with environmental affordances, and especially social affordances that it is possible to construct the processes required for arriving at a solution. Lastly the concept of <italic>enactive problem solving</italic> is also able to explain the mechanisms underlying the adaptive heuristics of rational ecology. Its adaptive function is effective both in practical and motor tasks as well as in abstract and symbolic ones.</p>",

Participants were Italian native speakers who had acquired the second language late (after the age of 10). They performed semantic judgments on L1 and L2 literal, idiomatic and metaphorical action sentences after viewing a video of a hand performing an action that was related or unrelated to the verb used in the sentence. Results showed that responses to literal and metaphorical L1 sentences were faster when the action depicted was related to the verb used rather than when the action depicted was unrelated to the verb used. No differences were found for the idiomatic condition. In L2 we found that all responses to the three conditions were facilitated when the action depicted was related to the verb used. Moreover, we found that the difference between the unrelated and the related modalities was greater in L2 than in L1 for the literal and the idiomatic condition but not for the metaphorical condition. These findings are consistent with the embodied cognition hypothesis of language comprehension.",

      "abstractNote": "In spite of their striking differences with real-life perception, films are perceived and understood without effort. Cognitive film theory attributes this to the system of continuity editing, a system of editing guidelines outlining the effect of different cuts and edits on spectators. A major principle in this framework is the 180° rule, a rule recommendation that, to avoid spectators’ attention to the editing, two edited shots of the same event or action should not be filmed from angles differing in a way that expectations of spatial continuity are strongly violated. In the present study, we used high-density EEG to explore the neural underpinnings of this rule. In particular, our analysis shows that cuts and edits in general elicit early ERP component indicating the registration of syntactic violations as known from language, music, and action processing. However, continuity edits and cuts-across the line differ from each other regarding later components likely to be indicating the differences in spatial remapping as well as in the degree of conscious awareness of one's own perception. Interestingly, a time–frequency analysis of the occipital alpha rhythm did not support the hypothesis that such differences in processing routes are mainly linked to visual attention. On the contrary, our study found specific modulations of the central mu rhythm ERD as an indicator of sensorimotor activity, suggesting that sensorimotor networks might play an important role. We think that these findings shed new light on current discussions about the role of attention and embodied perception in film perception and should be considered when explaining spectators’ different experience of different kinds of cuts.",

      "abstractNote": "This study examined the eye movements of 24 children and adolescents as they read sentences containing temporary syntactic ambiguities. Prior research suggested that children primarily use grammatical information when making initial parsing decisions, and they tend to disregard semantic and contextual information. On each trial, participants read a garden path sentence (e.g., While the storm blew the boat sat in the shed), and, afterwards, they answered a comprehension question (e.g., Did the storm blow the boat?). The design was 2 × 2 (verb type × ambiguity) repeated measures. Verb type was optionally transitive or reflexive, and sentences were ambiguous or unambiguous. Results showed no differences in first pass reading times at the disambiguating verb (e.g., sat). However, regressions did show a significant interaction. The unambiguous-reflexive condition had approximately half the number of regressions, suggesting less processing difficulty in this condition. Developmentally, we found that adolescents had significantly better comprehension, which seemed to be linked to the increased tendency to regress from the disambiguating word. Findings are consistent with the assumption that the processing architecture is more restricted in children compared to adolescents. In addition, results indicated that variance in ambiguity resolution was associated with interference control but not working memory.",

In addition, half of the sentences were printed in a font that was easy to read (Times New Roman) and the other half were printed in a font that was more difficult to read (Old English). Word frequency, word predictability, and font difficulty effects were apparent in the eye movement data of both groups of readers. In the fixation time data, the pattern of results was the same, but the older readers had larger frequency and predictability effects than the younger readers. The older readers skipped words more often than the younger readers (as indicated by their skipping rate on selected target words), but they made more regressions back to the target words and more regressions overall. The E-Z Reader model was used as a platform to evaluate the results, and simulations using the model suggest that lexical processing is slowed in older readers and that, possibly as a result of this, they adopt a more risky reading strategy.

      "abstractNote": "How does gesturing help children learn? Gesturing might encourage children to extract meaning implicit in their hand movements. If so, children should be sensitive to the particular movements they produce and learn accordingly. Alternatively, all that may matter is that children move their hands. If so, they should learn regardless of which movements they produce. To investigate these alternatives, we manipulated gesturing during a math lesson. We found that children required to produce correct gestures learned more than children required to produce partially correct gestures, who learned more than children required to produce no gestures. This effect was mediated by whether children took information conveyed solely in their gestures and added it to their speech. The findings suggest that body movements are involved not only in processing old ideas, but also in creating new ones. We may be able to lay foundations for new knowledge simply by telling learners how to move their hands.",

      "abstractNote": "ABSTRACT. In investigations into perception-action systems, variability of observable behavior may be considered to (a) interfere with inquiry, (b) be neither detrimental nor particularly useful to inquiry, or (c) play a crucial role in inquiry. The authors underscore recent suggestions that alternative (c) is a preferred strategy for the study of many motor behaviors. In tutorial fashion, the authors review the concepts of variability and determinism with respect to postural and rhythmic movements. Study of the variability of those behaviors has revealed crucial features suggestive of underlying mechanisms and control, such as particular blends of noise and determinism (piecewise determinism). It has also revealed general lessons (for example, more variable does not mean more random and more controllable does not mean more deterministic) that may extend to other classes of perceptualmotor behavior.",

      "abstractNote": "Modelling human cognition and behaviour in rich naturalistic settings and under conditions of free movement of the head and body is a major goal of visual science. Eye tracking has turned out to be an excellent physiological means to investigate how we visually interact with complex 3D environments, real and virtual. This review begins with a philosophical look at the advantages (the Good) and the disadvantages (the Bad) in approaches with different levels of ecological naturalness (traditional tightly controlled laboratory tasks, low- and high-fidelity simulators, fully naturalistic real-world studies). We then discuss in more technical terms the differences in approach required “in the wild”, compared to “received” lab-based methods. We highlight how the unreflecting application of lab-based analysis methods, terminology, and tacit assumptions can lead to poor experimental design or even spurious results (the Ugly). The aim is not to present a “cook-book” of best practices, but to raise awareness of some of the special concerns that naturalistic research brings about. References to helpful literature are provided along the way. The aim is to provide an overview of the landscape from the point of view of a researcher planning serious basic research on the human mind and behaviour.",

      "abstractNote": "The present study investigates the relation between the reading process and text comprehension during naturalistic text reading. To that end, participants read easy and difficult texts while their eye movements were recorded. After each reading, participants filled-in comprehension questionnaires. We investigated classical measures of the reading process related to comprehension (fixation duration, regressive eye movements), as well as power-law scaling in eye movements that are indicative of degree of cognitive coordination during reading. The results show that text difficulty led to longer fixation durations and stronger power-law scaling in eye movements. Moreover, the degree of power-law scaling in eye movements was predictive of text comprehension. In line with previous research on natural text reading that utilized the self-paced reading method, power-law scaling turned out to be a superior predictor of reading comprehension compared to standard measures, suggesting that it is an effective measure of cognitive performance in complex reading tasks.",

      "abstractNote": "Reading comprehension is multidimensional and complex. The persistent challenges children, adolescents, and even adults face with reading comprehension call for concerted efforts to develop assessments that help identify sources of difficulties and to design instructional approaches to prevent or ameliorate these difficulties. Doing so requires drawing on extant research to understand the core components and processes of reading comprehension. This article reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on the construction of meaning during reading comprehension and derives implications for research, practice, and policy related to instruction and assessment. We focus specifically on the inferential processes that extract meaning from text and the sources of knowledge that facilitate the extraction and construction of meaning.",

      "abstractNote": "In recent decades, the science of reading acquisition has been advancing through interdisciplinary research in cognitive, psycholinguistic, developmental, genetic, neuroscience, cross-language, and experimental comparison studies of effective instruction. Some of the science of reading has emerged from the theory and research into the realm of practice and policy. Yet the science and practice of measuring \"reading comprehension\" has remained relatively immune to much of this foundational knowledge. Measuring Up questions the traditional format of reading comprehension tests, typically a single series of questions asked about a series of passages, and offers ideas and innovations we might expect in a next generation of 21st century reading assessments. Sabatini, Albro, and O'Reilly believe that in light of the move towards Common Core State Standards and assessments, as well as significant national investments in reading and literacy education, it is a critical and opportune time to bring together the research and measurement community to address fundamental issues of measuring reading comprehension, both in theory and in practice.",

      "abstractNote": "Reading comprehension is often conceptualized in terms of the internal processing of linguistic information and construction of accurate mental representations. In contrast, an ecologicalenactive approach rejects this internalist focus and instead emphasizes the dynamic process of reader-text coupling in which eye movements play a constitutive role. In this study, we employed recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) to examine the relationship between reading comprehension and eye movement dynamics, based on eye-tracking data from the Potsdam Textbook Corpus recorded from beginners and experts reading scientific texts, followed by comprehension questionnaires. Moreover, we compared the findings from RQA to classical eye movement measures (number of fixations, mean fixation duration, regression fixation proportion). The results indicated that classical eye movement measures did not predict reading comprehension reliably, whereas recurrences in gaze steps were reliably associated with reading comprehension proficiency. Contrary to our original hypothesis, experts showed more irregular, rather than more regular, eye movement dynamics, and these were linked to more proficient reading comprehension. In line with previous research on naturalistic reading using nonlinear methods, the present findings suggest that reading comprehension is best understood as emerging from interaction-dominant coordination processes.",

Instruments used to gather data were based on an expert validated 20-point comprehension test taken from a short story selection and an adopted 30-point Metacognitive Awareness Reading Inventory (MARI). Findings revealed that Tagalog was the most commonly spoken by the respondents, followed by Iloco and English with moderately high reading comprehension performance and average level in terms of familiarity and attitude towards the Filipino language. The Problem-Solving Strategies (PROB) was the most frequently used, followed by the Global Reading Strategies (GLOB) and the Support Reading Strategies (SUPP). The familiarity with the Filipino language and the use of Problem-solving Metacognitive Reading Strategies were found to have a significant relationship to students' reading comprehension performance.",

Emerging interface technologies are expanding the modalities with which learners can interact with these simulations, but the effects of these new interactions on conceptual understanding and student engagement have not been examined in great depth. We present here a study where middle school students learned about gravity and planetary motion in an immersive, whole-body interactive simulation, and we compared their learning and attitudes about science with students who used a desktop version of the same simulation. Results of the study indicate that enacting concepts and experiencing critical ideas in physics through whole-body activity leads to signiﬁcant learning gains, higher levels of engagement, and more positive attitudes towards science.",

College students with low and high levels of biology knowledge read two biology texts, one of which was high in cohesion and the other low in cohesion. The two groups were similar in reading skill. Participants’ text comprehension was assessed with openended comprehension questions that measure different levels of comprehension (i.e., text-based, local-bridging, global-bridging). Results indicated: (a) reading a high-cohesion text improved text-based comprehension; (b) overall comprehension was positively correlated with participants’ prior knowledge, and (c) the degree to which participants beneﬁted from reading a high-cohesion text depended on participants’ reading skill, such that skilled participants gained more from high-cohesion text.",

Two hundred and five students received a battery of tests evaluating their general knowledge, skills in applying four reading strategies (summary, self-questioning, clarification and prediction), and two reading comprehension tests. The findings revealed differential contributions of general knowledge and strategy application to reading comprehension. Compared with the academic students, semi-academics have deficient strategic skills. Vocational students, in addition to deficient strategic skills, have poor general knowledge, which further impedes their reading comprehension. The deficiency of students with learning disabilities goes beyond these two components. These results led us to recommend different foci of comprehension intervention for each group.",

But what is the relationship between scientific literacy and reading literacy? Three international data sets from the Programme on International Student Assessment (PISA) were used to calculate correlations between scientific literacy and reading literacy for 15-year-old students. Mean correlations at the individual student level across countries were .840 for the PISA 2000 data set, .805 for the PISA 2003 data set, and .819 for the PISA 2006 data set. In all three data sets, this correlation varied among countries, and the reading-science relationship was weakest in countries with low country mean reading scores. Three possible interpretations are discussed, favoring the interpretation that knowledge and skills that drive higher reading comprehension also drive higher science achievement.",

Several researchers have recently called into question the validity of the most common type of measures of strategy use in reading, self-report or introspective measures (i.e., the participant must report on his or her cognitive activity while not actually engaged in the activity). We administered three parallel strategy use measures to a sample of 30 ninth-grade students: a prospective self-report measure, a concurrent multiple-choice measure which required students to apply the strategies to specific passages, and a text on which we asked students to think aloud. We also collected two measures of reading comprehension—a standardized measure and free recall scores. Consistent with Veenman’s (2005) conclusions based on a literature review, the concurrent multiple-choice and think-aloud data were both significantly correlated with both of the comprehension scores and with each other, whereas the prospective self-report data had non-significant correlations with all of the other measures. We conclude by recommending concurrent measures for researchers who wish to study strategy use in reading comprehension.",

      "abstractNote": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of four instructional methods on students? mathematical reasoning and metacognitive knowledge. The participants were 384 eighth-grade students. The instructional methods were cooperative learning combined with metacognitive training (COOP+META), individualized learning combined with metacognitive training (IND+META), cooperative learning without metacognitive training (COOP), and individualized learning without metacognitive training (IND). Results showed that the COOP+META group significantly outperformed the IND +META group, which in turn significantly outperformed the COOP and IND groups on graph interpretation and various aspects of mathematical explanations. Furthermore, the metacognitive groups (COOP+META and IND +META) outperformed their counterparts (COOP and IND) on graph construction (transfer tasks) and metacognitive knowledge. This article presents theoretical and practical implications of the findings.",

      "abstractNote": "ABSTRACT— This article gives an overview of developmental trends in research on metacognition in children and adolescents. Whereas a first wave of studies focused on the assessment of declarative and procedural metacognitive knowledge in schoolchildren and adolescents, a second wave focused on very young children’s “theory of mind” (ToM). Findings from a recent longitudinal study are presented that demonstrate developmental links between early ToM and subsequent declarative metacognitive knowledge, mainly mediated by language competencies. The relevant literature further indicates that developmental trends in declarative and procedural metacognitive knowledge clearly differ. Whereas the findings for declarative metacognitive knowledge show steady improvement through childhood and adolescence, mainly due to increases in knowledge about strategies, the results are not similarly clear-cut for procedural metacognition. Age trends observed for this component of metacognition are significant for self-control activities but not pronounced for monitoring abilities. These findings have important implications for education, emphasizing the role of strategy training procedures in different instructional domains and illustrating teachers’ potential impact on the improvement of monitoring and control processes.",

Comprehension monitoring was defined as the identification and repair of misunderstandings when reading text. In the eye movement task, children read two sentences; the second included either a plausible or implausible word in the context of the first sentence. Stronger readers had shorter reading times overall suggesting faster processing of text. Generally fifth-graders reacted to the implausible word (i.e., longer gaze duration on the implausible v. the plausible word, which reflects lexical access). Students with stronger academic language, compared to those with weaker academic language, generally spent more time re-reading the implausible target compared to the plausible target. This difference increased from fall to spring. Results support the centrality of academic language for meaning integration, setting standards of coherence, and utilizing comprehension repair strategies.",

      "abstractNote": "<p>Embodiment theory proposes that knowledge is grounded in sensorimotor systems, and that learning can be facilitated to the extent that lessons can be mapped to these systems. This study with 109 college-age participants addresses two overarching questions: (a) how are immediate and delayed learning gains affected by the degree to which a lesson is embodied, and (b) how do the affordances of three different educational platforms affect immediate and delayed learning? Six 50 min-long lessons on centripetal force were created. The first factor was the degree of embodiment with two levels: (1) low and (2) high. The second factor was platform with three levels: (1) a large scale “mixed reality” immersive environment containing both digital and hands-on components called <italic>SMALLab</italic>, (2) an interactive whiteboard system, and (3) a mouse-driven desktop computer. Pre-tests, post-tests, and 1-week follow-up (retention or delayed learning gains) tests were administered resulting in a 2 × 3 × 3 design. Two knowledge subtests were analyzed, one that relied on more declarative knowledge and one that relied on more generative knowledge, e.g., hand-drawing vectors. Regardless of condition, participants made significant immediate learning gains from pre-test to post-test. There were no significant main effects or interactions due to platform or embodiment on immediate learning. However, from post-test to follow-up the level of embodiment interacted significantly with time, such that participants in the high embodiment conditions performed better on the subtest devoted to generative knowledge questions. We posit that better retention of certain types of knowledge can be seen over time when more embodiment is present during the encoding phase. This sort of retention may not appear on more traditional factual/declarative tests. Educational technology designers should consider using more sensorimotor feedback and gestural congruency when designing and opportunities for instructor professional development need to be provided as well.</p>",

      "abstractNote": "The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between reading strategy use and reading comprehension as mediated by reading rate amongst advanced EFL students who received eye movement training by Rapid Visual Presentation (RSVP) technology. Seventytwo EFL learners participated in the study and received instruction for enhancing their reading speed via Reading Trainer Application for twelve consecutive weeks. Their entry-level of reading strategies awareness was assessed by the Metacognitive Awareness of Reading Strategies Inventory prior to and after the study. Their reading comprehension was assessed by International English System Test before and after the study. Their reading rate was also recorded prior to and after the study. Modelling the relationship between strategy use and reading comprehension as mediated by reading rate was tested prior to the study and the findings showed that the model was not statistically significant. The model was reassessed after the experiment and the results lent credence to the fact that eye training via RSVP for speed reading led to a mediating role for reading rate in the relationship between strategy use and reading comprehension. The results support the fact that reading rate is a contributory factor in understanding reading passages and integrating speed reading training using the-state-of-the-art technologies into reading instruction should be considered in EFL reading courses.",

Design: A total of 104 children aged between 8 and 10 years were assigned to either (a) an embodied learning condition consisting of task-relevant physical activities, (b) a physical activity condition involving task-irrelevant physical activities, or (c) a control condition consisting of a sedentary teaching style. Within a 2-week teaching program, consisting of four learning sessions, children had to learn 20 foreign language words.\nMethod: Children were tested on their memory performance (cued recall test) after completion of the program and on their focused attention (d2-R test of attention) immediately after one learning session.\nResults: Linear mixed model analyses revealed both the embodied learning (d = 1.12) and the physical activity condition (d = 0.51) as being more effective in teaching children new words than the control condition. Children’s focused attention, however, did not differ between the three conditions.\nConclusions: The results are discussed in the light of embodied cognition and cognitive load theory. Implications for the inclusion of specific physical activities during the school day are proposed.",

      "abstractNote": "These 2 studies investigate the extent to which an Embodied Mixed Reality Learning Environment (EMRELE) can enhance science learning compared to regular classroom instruction. Mixed reality means that physical tangible and digital components were present. The content for the EMRELE required that students map abstract concepts and relations onto their gestures and movements so that the concepts would become grounded in embodied action. The studies compare an immersive, highly interactive learning platform that uses a motion-capture system to track students’ gestures and locomotion as they kinesthetically learn with a quality classroom experience (teacher and content were held constant). Two science studies are presented: chemistry titration and disease transmission. In the counterbalanced design 1 group received the EMRELE intervention, while the other group received regular instruction; after 3 days and a midtest, the interventions switched. Each study lasted for 6 days total, with 3 test points: pretest, midtest, and posttest. Analyses revealed that placement in the embodied EMRELE condition consistently led to greater learning gains (effect sizes ranged from 0.53 to 1.93), compared to regular instruction (effect sizes ranged from 0.09 to 0.37). Order of intervention did not affect the final outcomes at posttest. These results are discussed in relation to a new taxonomy of embodiment in educational settings. We hypothesize that the positive results are due to the embodiment designed into the lessons and the high degree of collaboration engendered by the co-located EMRELE.",

Empirical studies that specify conditions under which embodiment occurs in different domains will be discussed and evaluated. Examples of relevant domains are language comprehension (Tucker and Ellis, 1998), autobiographical memory (Dijkstra et al., 2007), gestures (Alibali et al., 2014), facial mimicry (Stel and Vonk, 2010), and problem solving (Wiemers et al., 2014). The focus of the review is on supporting claims regarding sensorimotor simulation as well as on factors that modulate dynamic relationships between sensorimotor components in action and cognitive domains, such as expertise (Boschker et al., 2002). This discussion takes place within the context of currently debated issues, specifically the need to specify the underlying mechanisms of embodied representations (Zwaan, 2014; Körner et al., 2015).",

Despite decades of research in reading comprehension, international and national reading scores indicate stagnant growth for U.S. adolescents. In this article, we review the theoretical and empirical research in reading comprehension. We first explore different theoretical models for comprehension and then focus on components shown to be important across models that represent potential targets for instruction. In the last part of the article, we consider solutions for translating research to practice and policies for improving instruction. Improving reading scores will require a concerted and collaborative effort by researchers, educators, and policy makers with a focus on long-term solutions. An early and sustained focus on developing background knowledge, vocabulary, inference, and comprehension monitoring skills across development will be necessary to improve comprehension.",

      "abstractNote": "Reading comprehension is strongly associated with academic achievement, including science achievement. A better understanding of reading comprehension processes in science text might hold promise for improving science achievement in the long run. We tested the fit of the direct and inferential mediation (DIME) model of reading comprehension (Cromley & Azevedo, 2007) with 737 students in an introductory biology course required for majors. Participants completed multiple choice measures of biology-specific prior-topic knowledge, inference, reading strategy use, reading vocabulary, word reading fluency, and reading comprehension in small groups in our laboratory. Using structural equation modeling to test the fit of the DIME model to the data, we found excellent fit indices for all models. However, the original DIME model fit significantly worse than the measurement model, and a modified model that included a path from reading vocabulary to reading strategy use fit significantly better. Results from the modified model suggest that comprehension interventions for undergraduate students with biology majors might use preteaching to build topic knowledge. We discuss the need for future experimental studies to confirm the vocabulary-reading strategies link. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "abstractNote": "The Body–Object Interaction (BOI) variable measures how easily a human body can physically interact with a word's referent (Siakaluk, Pexman, Aguilera, Owen, & Sears, ). A facilitory BOI effect has been observed with adults in language tasks, with faster and more accurate responses for high BOI words (e.g., mask) than for low BOI words (e.g., ship; Wellsby, Siakaluk, Owen, & Pexman, ). We examined the development of this effect in children. Fifty children (aged 6–9 years) and a group of 21 adults completed a word naming task with high and low BOI words. Younger children (aged 6–7 years) did not show a BOI effect, but older children (aged 8–9 years) showed a significant facilitory BOI effect, as did adults. Magnitude of children's BOI effect was related to age as well as reading skills. These results suggest that bodily experience (as measured by the BOI variable) begins to influence visual word recognition behavior by about 8 years of age.",

      "abstractNote": "Over the past decade, theories of embodied cognition have become increasingly inﬂuential with research demonstrating that sensorimotor experiences are involved in cognitive processing; however, this embodied research has primarily focused on adult cognition. The notion that sensorimotor experience is important for acquiring conceptual knowledge is not a novel concept for developmental researchers, and yet theories of embodied cognition often do not fully integrate developmental ﬁndings. We propose that in order for an embodied cognition perspective to be reﬁned and advanced as a lifelong theory of cognition, it is important to consider what can be learned from research with children. In this paper, we focus on development of concepts and language processing, and examine the importance of children’s embodied experiences for these aspects of cognition in particular. Following this review, we outline what we see as important developmental issues that need to be addressed in order to determine the extent to which language and conceptual knowledge are embodied and to reﬁne theories of embodied cognition.",

A computerised version of the peg‐moving task was used repeatedly to assess hand skill of the dominant and the nondominant hand. Cognitive performance was repeatedly evaluated by tasks involving speech, vocabulary, phonological memory, and visual‐spatial skills. Results showed that: (i) age, sex, and handedness effects on hand skill asymmetry generally confirmed previous reports, especially by Annett (2002); (ii) visual‐spatial and vocabulary tasks were significantly related to hand skill but speech and phonological memory tasks were not, and the role of the dominant and nondominant hand were similar; (iii) overall, manual laterality indexes were only weakly associated to some cognitive abilities; (iv) early manual skill was more strongly associated to cognitive tasks than later manual skill. These results fit the assumption of a significant role of early manual behaviour in aspects of cognitive development not relying exclusively on phonology, and raise questions about cognitive development and rehabilitation of children with early occurring manual deficiencies.",

An extensive literature search was undertaken and the subsequent ndings evaluated with particular reference to issues surrounding symptom co-occurrence, as well as to theoretical and aetiological accounts of SLI. Clearly substantial co-morbidity exists between SLI and poor motor skill, suggesting that SLI is not a speci c disorder of language, but rather that children with SLI experience a broader range of diYculties, of which motor incoordination is one. Current theoretical explanations of SLI do not account fully for such wide-ranging diYculties and it may be useful in the future to focus on a more detailed explanation in terms of shared cognitive processes or neuromaturational delay to understand further the nature of the disorder, to explain it theoretically and to deal with it practically.",

The idea is growing that DCD may not be a uniform disorder. This review summarizes research on DCD, with a particular focus on subtype and comorbidity studies. The main message of the paper is that, in order to understand the etiology and prognosis of DCD, we need to have a better understanding of its nature. This requires an awareness of the existence of subtypes and comorbidities. Current theories on comorbidity phenomena are discussed in terms of their possible merit for the development of the ﬁeld. Particular attention is given to the Automatization Deficit Hypothesis, a theory based on research on dyslexia.",

      "abstractNote": "Reading comprehension, much like comprehension of situations and comprehension of oral language, is embodied. In all cases, comprehension is the ability to take effective action on the basis of affordances related to the body, the physical world, and personal goals and cultural norms. In language contexts, action-based comprehension arises from simulating the linguistic content using neural and bodily systems of perception, action, and emotion. Within this framework, a new approach to teaching reading comprehension is described: Teach children how to simulate while reading. The Moved by Reading intervention teaches simulation in two stages. In the first stage, physical manipulation, children manipulate toys to simulate the content of what they are reading. After success in physically manipulating the toys, the children are taught to manipulate the toys in imagination. Research demonstrates that both physical and imagined manipulation leads to large gains in memory and comprehension.",

      "abstractNote": "Reading practice is associated with numerous psychological benefits. However, its influence over individual emotional dimensions has generally been underestimated by research. Only recently has it been recognized across different developmental stages but evidence is still scarce. The aim of this systematic review is to shed light over the association between reading and the several (and sometimes hardly distinguishable) socio-emotional constructs that we have identified in literature: interpersonal skills and prosocial behavior; emotional and behavioral symptoms; emotional regulation and expression; empathy and theory of mind; emotional knowledge and comprehension; and emotional responses. A total of 50 studies were analyzed, including all age groups, various settings, research drawings, and different emotional constructs in order to create a comprehensive view of the association between reading and emotions. Results show that overall reading practice has a positive impact on socio-emotional development, whatever its declination, regardless of age, gender or setting of implementation.",

Children with reading difficulties also experience a\nbroad range of social and emotional difficulties, such as low self-esteem,\nanxiety and depression. The aim of the study was to determine whether there\nis a linkage between emotional and cognitive-control difficulties and\nchallenges in reading in children with reading difficulties compared to\ntypical readers.\n\nMethods:\nChildren 8–12 years of age (N=98) either with reading\ndifficulties or typical readers participated in the current study. Cognitive\ncontrol, specifically executive functions, and emotional and reading\nabilities were compared between the two groups and correlated.\n\nResults:\nChildren with reading difficulties showed significantly lower\nexecutive functions and emotional abilities compared to typical readers.\nDecreased reading ability was related to decreased executive functions and\nemotional abilities.\n\nConclusion:\nThe results provide insight regarding the relationship between\ncognitive, emotional and reading abilities: executive functions difficulties\nmay cause emotional stress, which in turn decreases the ability to monitor,\ninhibit and pay attention to the written material, which impair reading to a\ngreater degree. Results support the need for an emotional evaluation in\nchildren with reading difficulties that can be performed in a\npaediatrician’s consulting room.",

A model for college reading programs is designed, drawing on evidence that reading development continues beyond college and career readiness levels. It is proposed that the content of such programs should emphasize elements of reading such as metacognition, critical analysis, multimodal reading, creative thinking, and flexibility with electronic forms of reading. Opportunities to develop such capacities would serve both college students and other adult populations in acquiring the literacies required for professional, social, and personal well-being in the 21st century.",

It looks at the cognitive, affective, and motivational factors underlying adult literacy; adult literacy in different countries; and the educational approaches being taken to help improve adults’ literacy skills. It includes not only adults enrolled in adult literacy programs, but postsecondary students with low literacy skills, some of whom have reading disabilities. The first section of The Wiley Handbook of Adult Literacy covers issues such as phonological abilities in adults who have not yet learned to read; gender differences in the reading motivation of adults with low literacy skills; literacy skills, academic self-efficacy, and participation in prison education; and more. Chapters on adult literacy, social change and sociocultural factors in South Asia and in Ghana; literacy, numeracy, and self-rated health among U.S. adults; adult literacy programs in Southeastern Europe and Turkey, and a review of family and workplace literacy programs are among the topics featured in the second section. The last part examines how to teach reading and writing to adults with low skills; adults’ transition from secondary to postsecondary education; implications for policy, research, and practice in the adult education field; educational technologies that support reading comprehension; and more.  Looks at the cognitive processing challenges associated with low literacy in adults Features contributions from a global team of experts in the field Offers writing strategy instruction for low-skilled postsecondary students   The Wiley Handbook of Adult Literacy is an excellent book for academic researchers, teacher educators, professional developers, program designers, and graduate students. It’s also beneficial to curriculum developers, adult basic education and developmental education instructors, and program administrators, as well as clinicians and counselors who provide services to adults with reading disabilities.",

In presenting a synthesis of over 40 studies across interdisciplinary journals, the goal was to construct a generalized understanding of the field's conversations about undergraduate reading and the extent to which disciplinary literacy approaches foreground them. Analysis revealed that while the past work of postsecondary scholars has considerably influenced the field's knowledge base of postsecondary reading issues, attempts to understand reading within authentic disciplinary contexts remains generally obscured from modern prospects of disciplinary literacies, offering opportunities for advancing the next 50 years of reading scholarship.",

This study examined the contributions of student factors specified by the Proficient Academic Reader framework—reading literacy skills, metacog­ nitive reading strategies, and reading motivation—to perfor­ mance on a complex academic reading task and cumulative GPA across three semesters within the first two years of college. Hierarchical regression models were estimated using a sample of 166 students at a four-year public institution. Results indi­ cated the importance of vocabulary, reading comprehension, and problem-solving reading strategies to academic reading performance and early college GPA. However, some of these effects diminished after controlling for students’ standardized test scores and high school GPA. The findings imply that institu­ tions should implement sustained support for reading skills and strategies across disciplines.",

We found that different skills predicted the development of each. Reading comprehension skill measured in Year 3 was a strong predictor of comprehension in Year 6; vocabulary and verbal IQ also made significant unique contributions to the prediction of comprehension ability across time. Three comprehension components (inference, comprehension monitoring, and knowledge and use of story structure) emerged as distinct predictors of reading comprehension in Year 6, even after the autoregressive effect of comprehension was controlled. For word reading accuracy, early measures of word reading accuracy and phonemic awareness predicted later performance.",

      "abstractNote": "During collaborative problem solving (CPS), coordination occurs at different spatial and temporal scales. This multiscale coordination should, at least on some scales, play a functional role in facilitating effective collaboration outcomes. To evaluate this, we conducted a study of computer-based CPS with 42 dyads. We used cross-wavelet coherence as a way to examine the degree to which movement coordination is evident at a variety of scales and tested whether the observed coordination was greater than both the amount expected due to chance and due to task demands. We found that coordination at scales less than 2s was greater than expected due to chance and at most scales (except 16s, 1m, and 2m) was greater than expected due to task demands. Lastly, we evaluated whether the degree of coherence at scales less than 2s, and the form of coordination (in terms of relative phase), were predictive of CPS performance. We found that .25s and 1s scales were predictive of performance. When including relative phase, our results suggest that higher in-phase movement coordination at the 1s scale was the strongest predictor of CPS performance. We discuss these findings and detail their relevance for expanding our knowledge on how coordination facilitates CPS.",

      "abstractNote": "Successful interaction requires complex coordination of body movements. Previous research has suggested a functional role for coordination and especially synchronization (i.e., time-locked movement across individuals) in different types of human interaction contexts. Although such coordination has been shown to be nearly ubiquitous in human interaction, less is known about its function. One proposal is that synchrony supports and facilitates communication (Topics Cogn Sci 1:305–319, 2009). However, questions still remain about what the properties of coordination for optimizing communication might look like. In the present study, dyads worked together to construct towers from uncooked spaghetti and marshmallows. Using cross-recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis, we found that dyads with loosely coupled gross body movements performed better, supporting recent work suggesting that simple synchrony may not be the key to effective performance (Riley et al. 2011). We also found evidence that leader–follower dynamics—when sensitive to the speciﬁc role structure of the interaction—impact task performance. We discuss our results with respect to the functional role of coordination in human interaction.",

      "abstractNote": "The study of interpersonal synchrony examines how interacting individuals grow to have similar behavior, cognition, and emotion in time. Many of the established methods of analyzing interpersonal synchrony are costly and time-consuming; the study of bodily synchrony has been especially laborious, traditionally requiring researchers to hand-code movement frame by frame. Because of this, researchers have been searching for more efficient alternatives for decades. Recently, some researchers (e.g., Nagaoka & Komori (IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems, 91(6), 1634–1640, 2008); Ramseyer & Tschacher, 2008) have applied computer science and computer vision techniques to create frame-differencing methods (FDMs) to simplify analyses. In this article, we provide a detailed presentation of one such FDM, created by modifying and adding to existing FDMs. The FDM that we present requires little programming experience or specialized equipment: Only a few lines of MATLAB code are required to execute an automated analysis of interpersonal synchrony. We provide sample code and demonstrate its use with an analysis of brief, friendly conversations; using linear mixed-effects models, the measure of interpersonal synchrony was found to be significantly predicted by time lag (p < .001) and by the interaction between time lag and measures of interpersonal liking (p < .001). This pattern of results fits with existing literature on synchrony. We discuss the current limitations and future directions for FDMs, including their use as part of a larger methodology for capturing and analyzing multimodal interaction.",

      "abstractNote": "The authors analyzed fluctuations in timing errors when 8 human participants attempted to coordinate movement with external rhythmic signals. The temporal dynamics of the errors is usually described in terms of simple, self-correcting models. Here the authors demonstrate that timing errors are characterized by a 1/f(alpha) type of long memory process. The value of the exponent alpha differentiates different types of coordination states: synchronization and syncopation. More interesting, evidence was found that alpha can be changed when participants use different coordination strategies. Together with the authors' understanding of the generation mechanism for long memory processes, these results suggest that 1/f(alpha) type of long-range correlated timing errors are of higher cortical origin and are likely the outcome of distributed neural processes acting on multiple time scales.",

      "abstractNote": "It has been shown that the fractal scaling properties of heart rate dynamics, in healthy aging, differ from that seen in heart disease and this favors the use of fluctuation measures as diagnostic tools. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fractal heart rate dynamics in adults with Down syndrome (DS) under different physiological conditions (rest, exercise and post-exercise recovery) and compare their responses with those of nondisabled individuals. Fourteen participants (10 males; and 4 females) with DS and 13 nondisabled (9 males, and 4 females) controls performed maximal and submaximal treadmill tests with metabolic and heart rate measurements. Detrended fluctuation analysis was performed on the last 256 consecutive R–R intervals obtained under the following conditions: (1) standing rest, (2) submaximal treadmill exercise and (3) standing post-exercise recovery. Participants with DS presented lower chronotropic response than controls to peak and submaximal exercise (p<0.05). The short-term scaling exponent (α1) was greater in the DS group at rest (1.29±0.06 vs 1.07±0.08), during exercise (1.24±0.09 vs 0.99±0.08) and recovery (1.31±0.06 vs 1.21±0.06) (p<0.05). Furthermore, the fractal scaling distance score (I1−α1I) of participants with DS was also greater than that of controls under each physiological condition (p<0.05). This confirmed their greater fractal distance from the healthy value of 1.0. In conclusion, adults with DS show a breakdown of scale-invariant organization in heart rate dynamics towards Brownian noise and this is similar to that described in healthy aging.",

      "abstractNote": "Until recently, quantitative studies of walking have typically focused on properties of a typical or average stride, ignoring the stride-to-stride fluctuations and considering these fluctuations to be noise. Work over the past two decades has demonstrated, however, that the alleged noise actually conveys important information. The magnitude of the stride-to-stride fluctuations and their changes over time during a walk – gait dynamics – may be useful in understanding the physiology of gait, in quantifying age-related and pathologic alterations in the locomotor control system, and in augmenting objective measurement of mobility and functional status Indeed, alterations in gait dynamics may help to determine disease severity, medication utility, and fall risk, and to objectively document improvements in response to therapeutic interventions, above and beyond what can be gleaned from measures based on the average, typical stride. This review discusses support for the idea that gait dynamics has meaning and may be useful in providing insight into the neural control of locomtion and for enhancing functional assessment of aging, chronic disease, and their impact on mobility.",

      "abstractNote": "OBJECTIVE: To review the relationship between literacy and health outcomes. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), Public Affairs Information Service (PAIS), Industrial and Labor Relations Review (ILLR), PsychInfo, and Ageline from 1980 to 2003. STUDY SELECTION: We included observational studies that reported original data, measured literacy with any valid instrument, and measured one or more health outcomes. Two abstractors reviewed each study for inclusion and resolved disagreements by discussion. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer abstracted data from each article into an evidence table; the second reviewer checked each entry. The whole study team reconciled disagreements about information in evidence tables. Both data extractors independently completed an 11-item quality scale for each article; scores were averaged to give a final measure of article quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: We reviewed 3,015 titles and abstracts and pulled 684 articles for full review; 73 articles met inclusion criteria and, of those, 44 addressed the questions of this report. Patients with low literacy had poorer health outcomes, including knowledge, intermediate disease markers, measures of morbidity, general health status, and use of health resources. Patients with low literacy were generally 1.5 to 3 times more likely to experience a given poor outcome. The average quality of the articles was fair to good. Most studies were cross-sectional in design; many failed to address adequately confounding and the use of multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Low literacy is associated with several adverse health outcomes. Future research, using more rigorous methods, will better define these relationships and guide developers of new interventions.",

      "abstractNote": "Prior studies of studentsqqaposxx and adultsqqaposxx cognitive competence have shown large differences between nations, equivalent to a difference of 5 to 10 years of schooling. These differences seem to be relevant because studies using different research paradigms have demonstrated that population-level cognitive abilities are related to a number of important societal outcomes, including productivity, democratization, and health. In this overview of transnational differences, we document a number of positive predictors of international differences in student competence, including the amount of preschool education, student discipline, quantity of education, attendance at additional schools, early tracking, the use of centralized exams and high-stakes tests, and adult educational attainment. We found rather negative relationships for grade retention rates, age of school onset, and class size. Altogether, these results, when combined with the outcomes of earlier studies, demonstrate that international differences in cognitive competence can be explained in part by aspects of the respective countriesqqaposxx educational systems and that these differences consequently can be reduced by reform of their educational policy. This has important implications not just for closing gaps in educational achievement, but for narrowing international gaps in wealth, health, and democracy.",

      "abstractNote": "Reading is a complex skill involving the orchestration of a number of components. Researchers often talk about a “model of reading” when talking about only one aspect of the reading process (for example, models of word identification are often referred to as “models of reading”). Here, we review prominent models that are designed to account for (1) word identification, (2) syntactic parsing, (3) discourse representations, and (4) how certain aspects of language processing (e.g., word identification), in conjunction with other constraints (e g., limited visual acuity, saccadic error, etc.), guide readers’ eyes. Unfortunately, it is the case that these various models addressing specific aspects of the reading process seldom make contact with models dealing with other aspects of reading. Thus, for example, the models of word identification seldom make contact with models of eye movement control, and vice versa. While this may be unfortunate in some ways, it is quite understandable in other ways because reading itself is a very complex process. We discuss prototypical models of aspects of the reading process in the order mentioned above. We do not review all possible models, but rather focus on those we view as being representative and most highly recognized.",

Rev. 9, 399–431 (1929)]. However, recent studies [Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 1343–1346 (1993); Fractals in Biology and Medicine (Birkhauser-Verlag, Basel, 1994), pp. 55–65] reveal that under normal conditions, beat-to-beat fluctuations in heart rate display the kind of long-range correlations typically exhibited by dynamical systems far from equilibrium [Phys. Rev. Lett. 59, 381–384 (1987)]. In contrast, heart rate time series from patients with severe congestive heart failure show a breakdown of this long-range correlation behavior. We describe a new method—detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA)—for quantifying this correlation property in non-stationary physiological time series. Application of this technique shows evidence for a crossover phenomenon associated with a change in short and long-range scaling exponents. This method may be of use in distinguishing healthy from pathologic data sets based on differences in these scaling properties.",

      "abstractNote": "For years, teachers thought that if students could learn to decode words accurately, they would be successful in reading printed text. While it is true that accuracy in decoding is important for fluency, it is not the entire story.  Readers not only need to decode the words  accurately; they also need to decode them effortlessly or automatically.  The ability to read with appropriate phrasing and expression (interpretation) is also important for fluency.  In essence, reading fluency refers to accurate and automatic decoding of the words in the  text, along with expressive interpretation of the text, to achieve optimal comprehension. Fluency is important in reading, then, because it affects how well readers understand what they read.",

      "abstractNote": "As humans, we continuously adapt our behavior to changes in our environment, and our cognitive abilities continuously develop over time. A major question for scientists has been to discover the (cognitive) mechanism that underlies the control of human behavior in real-time, as well as cognitive development on the long-term. This chapter will discuss two kinds of general approaches, which we shall refer to as the reductionist approach and the complex dynamic systems (CDS) approach. Roughly speaking, the reductionist approach assumes that separate cognitive components, such as brain areas or processing mechanisms, are primarily responsible for behavior and development, by processing (and responding to) specific environmental cues. The CDS approach assumes that cognition, and thereby the control of behavior and development, are distributed over the brain, body, and environment, which continuously interact over time. The aim of this chapter is to compare the two approaches in terms of their assumptions, research strategies, and analyses. Furthermore, we will discuss the extent to which current research data in the cognitive domain can be explained by the two different approaches. Based on this review, we conclude that the CDS approach, which assumes a ‘complex’ rather than a ‘complicated’ model of cognition, provides the most plausible approach to cognition.",

Its functionality derives from striking a balance between independence versus interdependence among component activities, e.g., fin or leg oscillations in lipfish and centipede models, respectively. A similar balancing act in the Ising (1925) model was found to produce patterns of electron spin alignment, analogous to the softassembly of locomotive patterns. The Ising model analog to relative coordination is metastability, and Kelso (1995) hypothesized that metastability is essential to sensorimotor functions across levels and domains of analysis, from individual neurons to neural systems to anatomical components of all kinds. In the present survey, relative coordination and metastability are hypothesized to underlie the soft-assembly of sensorimotor function, and this hypothesis is shown to predict 1/f scaling as a pervasive property of intrinsic fluctuations. Evidence is reviewed in support of this prediction from studies of human neural activity, as well as response time tasks and speech production tasks.",

      "abstractNote": "Time series of human performances present fluctuations around a mean value. These fluctuations are typically considered as insignificant, and attributable to random noise. Over recent decades, it became clear that temporal fluctuations possess interesting properties, however, one of which the property of fractal 1/\n              f\n              scaling. 1/\n              f\n              scaling indicates that a measured process extends over a wide range of timescales, suggesting an assembly over multiple scales simultaneously. This paper reviews neurological, physiological, and cognitive studies that corroborate the claim that 1/\n              f\n              scaling is most clearly present in healthy, well-coordinated activities. Prominent hypotheses about the origins of 1/\n              f\n              scaling are confronted with  these reviewed studies. It is concluded that 1/\n              f\n              scaling in living systems appears to reflect their genuine complex nature, rather than constituting a coincidental side-effect. The consequences of fractal dynamics extending from the small spatial and temporal scales (e.g., neurons) to the larger scales of human behavior and  cognition, are vast, and impact the way in which relevant research questions may be approached. Rather than focusing on specialized isolable subsystems, using additive linear methodologies, nonlinear dynamics, more elegantly so, imply a complex systems methodology, thereby exploiting, rather than rejecting, mathematical concepts that enable describing large sets of natural phenomena.",

      "abstractNote": "In my recent book Affective Gibsonian Psychology (2022), I made a relatively sharp distinction between affordances and invitations. I argued that to understand (some of) our behavior, we need to distinguish between the two. In the present paper, I develop the argument for this distinction a little further. It is argued that the concept of affordances aids in capturing the ecological values in the animals’ environments. This helps one to determine the adaptiveness and appropriateness of behavior. However, drawing upon examples from everyday life, it is argued that the concept of affordances does not suffice to account for our behavior. It needs to be complemented by the concept of the field of invitations. We are affective beings—the world always affects us, and it does so in a rich variety of ways. Hence, any psychology attempting to understand our everyday activity needs to capture how we are moved by the environment. I end with detailing the field of invitations.",

Participants performed a simple rhythmic movement task with the intention of controlling either movement period or amplitude, either with or without an experimental stimulus designed to constrain period. In the absence of the stimulus, differences in intention did not produce any changes in power-law scaling. When the stimulus was present, however, a shift toward more random fluctuations occurred in the corresponding task dimension, regardless of participants’ intentions. More importantly, participants’ intentions interacted with available task constraints to produce an even greater shift toward random variation when the task dimension constrained by the stimulus was also the dimension the participant intended to control. Together, the results suggest that intentions serve to more tightly constrain behavior to existing environmental constraints, evidenced by changes in the fractal scaling of task performance.",

      "abstractNote": "The process of connected text reading has received very little attention in contemporary cognitive psychology. This lack of attention is in parts due to a research tradition that emphasizes the role of basic lexical constituents, which can be studied in isolated words or sentences. However, this lack of attention is in parts also due to the lack of statistical analysis techniques, which accommodate interdependent time series. In this study, we investigate text reading performance with traditional and nonlinear analysis techniques and show how outcomes from multiple analyses can used to create a more detailed picture of the process of text reading. Specifically, we investigate reading performance of groups of literate adult readers that differ in reading fluency during a self-paced text reading task. Our results indicate that classical metrics of reading (such as word frequency) do not capture text reading very well, and that classical measures of reading fluency (such as average reading time) distinguish relatively poorly between participant groups. Nonlinear analyses of distribution tails and reading time fluctuations provide more fine-grained information about the reading process and reading fluency.",

      "abstractNote": "The present study investigated the comparability of two video-based tracking techniques, namely, Motion Energy Analysis and OpenPose, in the context of nonverbal synchrony research. Participants aged 23–69 years held a 15-min unstructured conversation with a same-gender partner of the same generation. Each participant’s movements were quantified with two algorithms, which were separately submitted to a wavelet transform to assess synchrony between the partners. Wavelet coherence and information in the relative phase were used to measure the intensities and patterns of synchrony, respectively. As a benchmark of the test results, gender effects and correlation with the Big Five personality traits were examined. Irrespective of the tracking technique used, the results consistently illustrated gender effects: female dyads showed more synchrony than male dyads. Among the Big Five personality traits, only Extraversion was significantly associated with synchrony in either tracking technique. The gender effect remained significant in both the tracking techniques even when controlling for personality traits, indicating that both individual (i.e., personality) and social (i.e., gender) factors contribute to synchrony. The use of video-tracking techniques in the research on synchrony for future studies was also discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is a scaling analysis method used to estimate long-range power-law correlation exponents in noisy signals. Many noisy signals in real systems display trends, so that the scaling results obtained from the DFA method become difficult to analyze. We systematically study the effects of three types of trends -- linear, periodic, and power-law trends, and offer examples where these trends are likely to occur in real data. We compare the difference between the scaling results for artificially generated correlated noise and correlated noise with a trend, and study how trends lead to the appearance of crossovers in the scaling behavior. We find that crossovers result from the competition between the scaling of the noise and the ``apparent'' scaling of the trend. We study how the characteristics of these crossovers depend on (i) the slope of the linear trend; (ii) the amplitude and period of the periodic trend; (iii) the amplitude and power of the power-law trend and (iv) the length as well as the correlation properties of the noise. Surprisingly, we find that the crossovers in the scaling of noisy signals with trends also follow scaling laws -- i.e. long-range power-law dependence of the position of the crossover on the parameters of the trends. We show that the DFA result of noise with a trend can be exactly determined by the superposition of the separate results of the DFA on the noise and on the trend, assuming that the noise and the trend are not correlated. If this superposition rule is not followed, this is an indication that the noise and the superimposed trend are not independent, so that removing the trend could lead to changes in the correlation properties of the noise.",

      "abstractNote": "In this contribution, we perform detrended ﬂuctuation analysis on eye movement data obtained using an eye tracker with different experimentation subjects performing a set of distinct cognitive tasks. We deﬁne three different paradigms: spotting differences among two similar pictures, answering questions in a multiple choice questionnaire, and performing the Trail Making Test to measure subject attention. Using multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (MDFA) we evaluate the Hurst exponent, the multifractal spectrum and correlation coefﬁcient of the subjects’ eye movements under these different cognitive tasks. Under these paradigms, the MDFA presents a characteristic f (α) spectrum, showing that the organizational structure of the data reﬂects the ocular activities of the subjects under the different tasks. An interpretation of the MDFA spectrum features provides insights on the internal cognitive strategies deployed in each of the paradigms.",

      "abstractNote": "The complex-systems approach to cognitive science seeks to move beyond the formalism of information exchange and to situate cognition within the broader formalism of energy ﬂow. Changes in cognitive performance exhibit a fractal (i.e., power-law) relationship between size and time scale. These fractal ﬂuctuations reﬂect the ﬂow of energy at all scales governing cognition. Information transfer, as traditionally understood in the cognitive sciences, may be a subset of this multiscale energy ﬂow. The cognitive system exhibits not just a single power-law relationship between ﬂuctuation size and time scale but actually exhibits many power-law relationships, whether over time or space. This change in fractal scaling, that is, multifractality, provides new insights into changes in energy ﬂow through the cognitive system. We survey recent ﬁndings demonstrating the role of multifractality in (a) understanding atypical developmental outcomes, and (b) predicting cognitive change. We propose that multifractality provides insights into energy ﬂows driving the emergence of cognitive structure.",

      "abstractNote": "We hypothesize that effective collaboration is facilitated when individuals and environmental components form a synergy where they work together and regulate one another to produce stable patterns of behavior, or regularity, as well as adaptively reorganize to form new behaviors, or irregularity. We tested this hypothesis in a study with 32 triads who collaboratively solved a challenging visual computer programming task for 20 min following an introductory warm-up phase. Multidimensional recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis was used to examine ﬁne-grained (i.e., every 10 s) collective patterns of regularity across team members’ speech rate, body movement, and team interaction with the shared user interface. We found that teams exhibited signiﬁcant patterns of regularity as compared to shufﬂed baselines, but there were no systematic trends in regularity across time. We also found that periods of regularity were associated with a reduction in overall behavior. Notably, the production of irregular behavior predicted expert-coded metrics of collaborative activity, such as teams’ ability to construct shared knowledge and effectively negotiate and coordinate execution of solutions, net of overall behavioral production and behavioral self-similarity. Our ﬁndings support the theory that groups can interact to form interpersonal synergies and indicate that information about system-level dynamics is a viable way to understand and predict effective collaborative processes.",

      "abstractNote": "Conventional scaling analyses of human movement variability such as detrended ﬂuctuation analyses assume that the movement variable can be decomposed into scale-dependent variation. However, these conventional scaling analyses are insensitive to multiplicative interactions within the movement variable. Multiplicative interactions refer to couplings between the scale-dependent variations across multiple scales that generate intermittent changes in the human movement variable. The mathematical concept for intermittent variability generated by multiplicative interactions is called multifractal variability. Multifractal variability is numerically deﬁned by a spectrum of scaling exponents (i.e., a multifractal spectrum) that can be an important feature of coordinated movements and, consequently, relevant when aiming to identify movement disorders. In the current study, a new method is introduced based on detrended ﬂuctuation analysis that can identify the multifractal spectrum from the temporal variation of local scaling exponents. The inﬂuence of multiplicative interactions on the local scaling exponents is tested by a Monte Carlo surrogate test. The methods are validated on multiplicative cascading processes with known multiplicative interactions. The application of the new methods is subsequently illustrated on an example of centre of pressure variations during quiet and relaxed standing. The results show that multiplicative interactions are present during periods with large movements of the center of gravity, where the movements of the centre of gravity and centre of pressure couple into coordinative structures. Further application and interpretation of the developed method for the study of human movement variability are discussed.",

We relate our multifractal DFA method to the standard partition function-based multifractal formalism, and prove that both approaches are equivalent for stationary signals with compact support. By analyzing several examples we show that the new method can reliably determine the multifractal scaling behavior of time series. By comparing the multifractal DFA results for original series to those for shuffled series we can distinguish multifractality due to long-range correlations from multifractality due to a broad probability density function. We also compare our results with the wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) method, and show that the results are equivalent.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent research using measures to assess the time-dependent structure of postural fluctuations has provided new insights into the stability and adaptability of human postural control in adults. To date, little research has examined how postural dynamics reflecting the stability and adaptability of postural control may change as a function of development, especially during supra-postural tasks. The goal of this study was to examine the dynamics of postural fluctuations during a manual-fitting task in which precision, visual and postural task constraints were altered in children and adults. Three age groups were tested: 7-, 10-year olds and college aged adults. Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) was used to assess the regularity (percent determinism) and complexity (entropy) of the center of pressure (CoP) in the anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions. The CoP patterns exhibited by adults were more deterministic and more complex (higher entropy) than those of the 7-year-old children under the different experimental manipulations. No differences between the adults and the 10-year-old children were observed. The increase in determinism with a corresponding increase in entropy exhibited by the adults and older-children during a manual fitting task may be a prospective mechanism over which postural movements follow a more predictable path allowing for stable and flexible task performance. Our results also support the notion that complex postural fluctuations (as measured by RQA entropy) are functional and typically increase as the precision requirements of a manual task increase.",

      "abstractNote": "We tested key predictions of a theoretical model positing that confusion, which accompanies a state of cognitive disequilibrium that is triggered by contradictions, conﬂicts, anomalies, erroneous information, and other discrepant events, can be beneﬁcial to learning if appropriately induced, regulated, and resolved. Hypotheses of the model were tested in two experiments where learners engaged in trialogues on scientiﬁc reasoning concepts in a simulated collaborative learning session with animated agents playing the role of a tutor and a peer student. Confusion was experimentally induced via a contradictoryinformation manipulation involving the animated agents expressing incorrect and/or contradictory opinions and asking the (human) learners to decide which opinion had more scientiﬁc merit. The results indicated that self-reports of confusion were largely insensitive to the manipulations. However, confusion was manifested by more objective measures that inferred confusion on the basis of learners’ responses immediately following contradictions. Furthermore, whereas the contradictions had no effect on learning when learners were not confused by the manipulations, performance on multiple-choice posttests and on transfer tests was substantially higher when the contradictions were successful in confusing learners. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "We propose a model to explain the dynamics of affective states that emerge during deep learning activities. The model predicts that learners in a state of engagement/ﬂow will experience cognitive disequilibrium and confusion when they face contradictions, incongruities, anomalies, obstacles to goals, and other impasses. Learners revert into the engaged/ﬂow state if equilibrium is restored through thought, reﬂection, and problem solving. However, failure to restore equilibrium as well as obstacles that block goals trigger frustration, which, if unresolved, will eventually lead to boredom. The major hypotheses of the model were supported in two studies in which participants completed a 32e35 min tutoring session with a computer tutor. Their affective states were tracked at approximately 110 points in their tutoring sessions via a retrospective affect judgment protocol. Time series analyses conﬁrmed the presence of confusioneengagement/ﬂow, boredomefrustration, and confusionefrustration oscillations. We discuss enhancements of the model to address individual differences and pedagogical and motivational strategies that are inspired by the model.",

      "abstractNote": "The incidence and dynamics of confusion during complex learning and problem solving were investigated in an experiment where participants ﬁrst read illustrated texts on everyday devices (e.g., an electric bell) followed by breakdown scenarios reﬂecting device malfunctions (e.g., “When a person rang the bell there was a short ding and then no sound was heard”). The breakdown scenarios were expected to trigger impasses and put participants in a state of cognitive disequilibrium where they would experience confusion and engage in effortful confusion resolution activities in order to restore equilibrium. The results conﬁrmed that participants reported more confusion when presented with the breakdown scenarios compared to control scenarios that involved focusing on important device components in the absence of malfunctions. A second-by-second analysis of the dynamics of confusion yielded two characteristic trajectories that distinguished participants who partially resolved their confusion from those who remained confused. Participants who were successful in partial confusion resolution while processing the breakdowns outperformed their counterparts on knowledge assessments after controlling for scholastic aptitude, engagement, and frustration. This effect was ampliﬁed for those who were highly confused by the breakdowns. There was no direct breakdown vs. control effect on learning, but being actively engaged and partially resolving confusion during breakdown processing were positive predictors of increased learning with the breakdown compared to control scenarios. Implications of our ﬁndings for theories that highlight the role of impasses, cognitive disequilibrium, and confusion to learning are discussed.",

The emphasis is not only on the cognitive states that give rise to epistemic emotions but also on the dynamics of epistemic emotions in complex learning situations. The interrelations between epistemic emotions and their interactions with affective states and metacognitive experiences are also explored. The position put forth is that epistemic emotions are triggered by cognitive states involving discrepancy, or conflict, between active schemas and incoming information, or gap in one’s knowledge. However, each of the epistemic emotions has its specific triggering conditions that differ­ entiate it from the others. Changing conditions during a cognitive endeavor impact the intensity as well as the interrelations between epistemic emotions. Also, there are relations between epistemic emotions and meta­ cognitive experiences such as feeling of difficulty or confidence, albeit not so strong. The implications for future research are discussed.",

The argument that supports a blue-collar role for the brain is also consistent with recent discoveries clarifying the white-collar role of synergies across the body’s tensegrity structure, and the evidence of critical phenomena in brain and behavior.",

      "abstractNote": "Many previous treatments of voluntary behavior have viewed intentions as causes of behavior. This has resulted in several dilemmas, including a dilemma concerning the origin of intentions. The present article circumvents traditional dilemmas by treating intentions as constraints that restrict degrees of freedom for behavior. Constraints self-organize as temporary dynamic structures that span the mind-body divide. This treatment of intentions and voluntary behavior yields a theory of intentionality that is consistent with existing ﬁndings and supported by current research.",

The authors of this article identify components of language, discourse, and cognition that underlie traditional automated metrics of text difficulty and their new Coh-Metrix system. Coh-Metrix analyzes texts on multiple measures of language and discourse that are aligned with multilevel theoretical frameworks of comprehension. The authors discuss five major factors that account for most of the variance in texts across grade levels and text categories: word concreteness, syntactic simplicity, referential cohesion, causal cohesion, and narrativity. They consider the importance of both quantitative and qualitative characteristics of texts for assigning the right text to the right student at the right time.",

Section II shifts to the practical arena, describing how to use Coh-Metrix and how to analyze, interpret, and describe results. Coh-Metrix opens the door to a new paradigm of research that coordinates studies of language, corpus analysis, computational linguistics, education, and cognitive science. This tool empowers anyone with an interest in text to pursue a wide array of previously unanswerable research questions.",

Consistently, undergraduates report that reading is valuable, yet their noncompliance with reading assignments suggests otherwise. Undergraduates report that they achieve their academic goals with little reading and that they perceive reading as too voluminous and irrelevant to class outcomes. The data highlight a misalignment between conventional academic expectations that undergraduates will read in scholarly ways and their actual academic reading practice. Qualitative analysis illustrates that students do not experience academic reading as a venue for scholarly engagement in disciplinary discourse. Whereas the academic reading literature proposes that students develop along a continuum from novice to expert reader, findings suggest that the undergraduate experience of academic reading is not representative of that continuum.",

For this restricted null assumption, random surrogates can be constructed which are constrained by the linear properties of the data. We propose a more general null hypothesis allowing for nonlinear rescalings of a Gaussian linear process. We show that such rescalings cannot be accounted for by a simple amplitude adjustment of the surrogates which leads to spurious detection of nonlinearity. An iterative algorithm is proposed to make appropriate surrogates which have the same autocorrelations as the data and the same probability distribution.",

      "abstractNote": "In an experiment on dyadic social interaction, we invited participants to verbal interactions in cooperative, competitive, and ‘fun task’ conditions. We focused on the link between interactants’ affectivity and their nonverbal synchrony, and explored which further variables contributed to affectivity: interactants’ personality traits, sex, and the prescribed interaction tasks. Nonverbal synchrony was quantiﬁed by the coordination of interactants’ body movement, using an automated video-analysis algorithm (motion energy analysis). Traits were assessed with standard questionnaires of personality, attachment, interactional style, psychopathology, and interpersonal reactivity. We included 168 previously unacquainted individuals who were randomly allocated to same-sex dyads (84 females, 84 males, mean age 27.8 years). Dyads discussed four topics of general interest drawn from an urn of eight topics, and ﬁnally engaged in a fun interaction. Each interaction lasted 5 min. In between interactions, participants repeatedly assessed their affect. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we found moderate to strong effect sizes for synchrony to occur, especially in competitive and fun task conditions. Positive affect was associated positively with synchrony, negative affect was associated negatively. As for causal direction, data supported the interpretation that synchrony entailed affect rather than vice versa. The link between nonverbal synchrony and affect was strongest in female dyads. The ﬁndings extend previous reports of synchrony and mimicry associated with emotion in relationships and suggest a possible mechanism of the synchrony-affect correlation.",

      "abstractNote": "A fundamental challenge for enactive theory and other radical varieties of non-representational “E cognition” is to reconceive the end-directed character of cognitive activity in naturally emergent but also experientially adequate terms. In short, it is necessary to show how cognitive activity is motivated. In this article, I present a preliminary analysis of the nature of motivation and the challenge that it presents to cognitive science. I make the case that a theory of motivation is a critical desideratum for dynamical theories of cognition, especially insofar as they understand cognition as a self-organized and “soft assembled” process. Finally, I propose that a branch of ecological psychology that conceives of cognition as a special variety of “dissipative adaptation” offers a promising framework for confronting this challenge.",

We collected evidence of structural, generalizability, and external aspects of validity for the revised inventory (MARSI-R). We first conducted a confirmatory factor analysis of the MARSI instrument, which resulted in the reduction of the number of strategy statements from 30 to 15. We then tested MARSI-R for factorial invariance across gender and ethnic groups and found that there is a uniformity in student interpretation of the reading strategy statements across these groups, thus allowing for their comparison on levels of metacognitive processing skills. We found evidence of the external validity aspect of MARSI-R data through correlations of such data with a measure of the students’ perceived reading ability. Given that this journal is oriented to second language learning and teaching, our article also includes comments on the Survey of Reading Strategies (SORS), which was based on the original MARSI and was designed to assess adolescents’ and adults’ metacognitive awareness and perceived use of ESL reading strategies. We provide a copy of the MARSI-R instrument and discuss the implications of the study’s findings in light of new and emerging insights relative to assessing students’ metacognitive awareness and perceived use of reading strategies.",

      "abstractNote": "Reading research and research on conversation have followed different paths: While the research program for reading committed itself to a relatively static view of language, where objective text properties serve to elicit speciﬁc effects on cognition and behavior of a reader, research on conversation has embraced a language-use perspective, where language is primarily seen as a dynamic, context dependent process. In this essay I contrast these two perspectives, and argue that in order to reach a uniﬁed understanding of natural language e be it reading, talking, or conversing e one needs to adopt a languageuse perspective. Furthermore, I describe how reading can be seen as a form of language-use, and how the current landscape of research on reading can be re-interpreted in terms of a dynamic, context-sensitive perspective on language. In particular, I propose that the concept of ‘language games’ serves as a good starting point to conceive reading as a form of language-use, describe how one can derive ﬁrst concrete hypotheses by re-interpreting reading in terms of language games, and show how they can be readily operationalized using tools from dynamic systems analysis.",

      "abstractNote": "The empirical study of reading dates back more than 125 years. But despite this long tradition, the scientiﬁc understanding of reading has made rather heterogeneous progress: many factors that inﬂuence the process of text reading have been uncovered, but theoretical explanations remain fragmented; no general theory pulls together the diverse ﬁndings. A handful of scholars have noted that properties thought to be at the core of the reading process do not actually generalize across different languages or from situations single-word reading to connected text reading. Such observations cast doubt on many of the traditional conceptions about reading. In this article, I suggest that the observed heterogeneity in the research is due to misguided conceptions about the reading process. Particularly problematic are the unreﬁned notions about meaning which undergird many reading theories: most psychological theories of reading implicitly assume a kind of elemental token semantics, where words serve as stable units of meaning in a text. This conception of meaning creates major conceptual problems. As an alternative, I argue that reading shoud be rather understood as a form of language use, which circumvents many of the conceptual problems and connects reading to a wider range of linguistic communication. Finally, drawing from Wittgenstein, the concept of “language games” is outlined as an approach to language use that can be operationalized scientiﬁcally to provide a new foundation for reading research.",

Based on this conceptual analysis I argue for two extensions of this construct: In addition to traditional applications, the methodology should be transferred to also measure calibration between students’ metacognitive control processes (traditionally, only students’ metacognitive judgments were considered) and important external criteria (traditionally, judgments were only compared to students’ own performance). As an illustrative example, one application context will be highlighted where these proposed extensions would alleviate potential problems with the traditional conceptualization: While students’ idiosyncratic task definitions constitute unwanted error variance in the traditional account it would be possible to investigate them as a primary research question within this extended notion. More specifically, it would be possible to investigate how well students’ learning processes match objective task demands. I will put forward theoretical and empirical arguments in favor of these suggestions.",

Embodied cognition challenges theories which assume that mental operations are based in a common, abstract, amodal code of propositions and schemata. Based on growing research in behavioral and neuroscience, embodied cognition proposes that all cognitive activity is based in sensorimotor activity, opening exciting new vistas for research and practice. Exemplary embodied theories are summarized and compared including those of Glenberg, Barsalou, Lakoff and Johnson, Paivio, and others. Exemplary embodied educational applications to reading comprehension are reviewed. I propose that much reading comprehension research that cites an abstract theoretical basis is actually more consistent with the embodied perspective.",

We review recent neuroscience research on correlates of proposed cognitive subprocesses in text decoding and reading comprehension and analyze some of the methodological and conceptual challenges of bridging neuroscience and literacy education research. We note that much more research on decoding processes in typically developing children is needed before profound implications for instruction can be expected. We also note that the diverse neural activity demonstrated in research on text comprehension contradicts our traditional categorical distinctions about the role of syntax, semantics, and discourse in meaning-making with language. We observe some of the debates within the neuroscience community regarding research design and statistical analysis and note two of the possibly competing theoretical frames for making sense of the brain and behavior. We conclude that contributions from neuroscience offer the possibility of interdisciplinary integration of brain, social, cognitive, and cultural perspectives in ways beneficial for reading education.",

In animals, such reflective monitoring and control processes have been grouped under the rubric of metacognition. In this introductory article to a Theme Issue on metacognition, we review recent and rapidly progressing developments from neuroscience, cognitive psychology, computer science and philosophy of mind. While each of these areas is represented in detail by individual contributions to the volume, we take this opportunity to draw links between disciplines, and highlight areas where further integration is needed. Specifically, we cover the definition, measurement, neurobiology and possible functions of metacognition, and assess the relationship between metacognition and consciousness. We propose a framework in which level of representation, order of behaviour and access consciousness are orthogonal dimensions of the conceptual landscape.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper aims at highlighting the importance for learning of one of the facets of metacognition, namely metacognitive experiences (ME) that comprise feelings, judgments or estimates, and online task-speciﬁc knowledge. The emphasis is on the affective character of ME, which has received little attention in the past. Unlike online task-speciﬁc knowledge, which is conscious and analytic, the other ME are products of nonconscious, nonanalytic inferential processes. Because of their nature, ME can trigger either rapid, nonconscious control decisions or conscious analytic ones. However, ME can make use of both the affective and the cognitive regulatory loops, and this has a series of implications for learning. Evidence is presented regarding the relations of ME with affect and cognition, and the implications of the lack of accuracy of ME for the self-regulation of learning. Particular emphasis is given on judgment of learning, feeling of difﬁculty, and feeling of conﬁdence. The challenges for future research on metacognition are underscored.",

      "abstractNote": "One routinely undergoes a noetic feeling (also called “meta­ cognitive feeling” or “epistemic feeling”), the so-called “feel­ ing of knowing”, whenever trying to recall a person’s name. One feels the name is known despite being unable to recall it. Other experiences also fall under this category, e.g., the tip-of -the-tongue experience, the feeling of confidence. A distinguishing characteristic of noetic feelings is how they are crucially related to the facts we know, so much so that the activation of semantic memory can easily result in the pro­ duction of noetic feelings – a regularity that memory research has often exploited. And yet little is known about the mechanism that produces noetic feelings. Is it solely brain-based or does it depend upon the extracerebral body for its production of feelings? To arrive at an answer, various studies in metamemory research will be analyzed to deter­ mine what ought to be made of the mechanism responsible for noetic feelings. I argue that evidence suggests that it relies upon extracerebral processes, in particular cardiovas­ cular processes, the result being support for an embodied view of metacognition.",

Is importance as embodied by weight used as a cue that items are memorable? Four experiments varied participants’ perceptual experiences of weight as they studied words and predicted later memory performance via judgments of learning (JOLs) for a recall (Experiment 1) or recognition (Experiments 2– 4) memory test. Greater weight was associated with higher JOLs, although weight did not affect actual memory performance. The relationship between weight and JOLs disappeared when participants were primed to think of cases where lightweight is a positive attribute and heavyweight is a negative attribute (Experiment 4). Even cognition about our own cognition is embodied.",

The present study builds upon this work, treating reading of text as a kind of complex coordination or coupling between reader and reading conditions. Three self-paced reading conditions presented connect text in units of different sizes: word, phrase, or sentence units, and repeatedly measure times between spacebar presses to advance the text. The three conditions reveal different patterns across the data. These patterns were evaluated using fractal analyses and Recurrent Quantification Analyses to distinguish highly fluent readers, PhD candidates in English literature, from competent but less fluent undergraduate readers.",

      "abstractNote": "The present article describes how to use eye tracking methodologies to study the cognitive processes involved in text comprehension. Measuring eye movements during reading is one of the most precise methods for measuring moment-by-moment (online) processing demands during text comprehension. Cognitive processing demands are reflected by several aspects of eye movement behavior, such as fixation duration, number of fixations, and number of regressions (returning to prior parts of a text). Important properties of eye tracking equipment that researchers need to consider are described, including how frequently the eye position is measured (sampling rate), accuracy of determining eye position, how much head movement is allowed, and ease of use. Also described are properties of stimuli that influence eye movements that need to be controlled in studies of text comprehension, such as the position, frequency, and length of target words. Procedural recommendations related to preparing the participant, setting up and calibrating the equipment, and running a study are given. Representative results are presented to illustrate how data can be evaluated. Although the methodology is described in terms of reading comprehension, much of the information presented can be applied to any study in which participants read verbal stimuli.",

Individual reading strategies were studied by having the participants read a long expository text while their eye fixation patterns were registered. A cluster analysis was performed on the eye movement data to distinguish between different reading styles. The analysis revealed three types of readers that were coined, following\n              Hyönä, Lorch, and Kaakinen (2002)\n              , fast linear readers, slow linear readers, and topic structure processors. Readers' procedural awareness of their reading behaviour was assessed by a questionnaire. The verbal reports obtained by the questionnaire were then correlated with the corresponding eye behaviour to investigate the extent to which the readers behave the way they report doing. The correlations showed that adult readers are well aware of their general reading speed and reasonably aware of their lookback and rereading behaviour. The amount of time spent looking back in text also correlated positively with the relative success in recalling the main points expressed in the text. It is concluded that systematic and extensive looking back in text is indicative of strategic behaviour.",

It is an ongoing topic of research to study the class of complexity, and how it may differ as a function of cognitive variables. Herein, we explore the eye movement trajectories generated during reading different Persian texts. Features of eye movement trajectories were recorded during reading Persian texts using an eye tracker device. We show that fixation durations, as the main components of eye movements reflecting cognitive processing exhibits multifractal behavior. This indicates that multiple exponents are needed to capture the neural and cognitive processes involved in decoding symbols to derive meaning. We test whether multifractal behavior varies as a function of two different stimuli including fonts, and familiarity of the text for readers during four different reading procedures concerning silent and aloud reading and goal-oriented versus non-goal-oriented reading. We find that, while mean fixation duration is affected by some of these factors, the multifractal pattern in time series of eye fixation durations did not change significantly. Our results suggest that multifractal dynamics may be intrinsic to the reading processes, and the lognormal distribution properly describes the statistics of the fixation duration time series for all the stimuli in our reading experiments.",

      "abstractNote": "The study of the multifractal characteristics of physiological processes attracted wide interest in recent decades, since evidence has been found that the presence of certain alterations in these processes is reflected in the variability of their dynamics. However, neurocognitive processes have not been so widely studied from this perspective. We aim to provide new insights regarding the alterations that dyslexia produces in eye movements during reading. For this reason, we performed fractal and multifractal analysis of eye movements of children with and without dyslexia. This investigation showed that disorders in the cognitive process of reading, such as the one caused by dyslexia, induce slight alterations in the variability of eye movements usually found in neurotypical subjects. In particular, we found differences in the dynamics of fixations and saccades presented by children with dyslexia, a fact that is reflected in the long-range correlation behavior of the recorded eye-tracking data. This finding may provide hints about the neurocognitive organization of the reading process and how it is altered in dyslexic subjects, and also an inexpensive and non-invasive means to detect the condition in its early stages.",

No research has, however, investigated how properties of the eye-tracking instrument might affect the structure of measurement varia-bility. The current experiment employed fractal and multifractal methods to investigate whether an eye-tracker produced intrinsic random variation and how features of the data recording procedure affected the structure measurement variability. The results of this experiment revealed that the structure of variation from a fake eye was indeed random and uncorrelated in contrast to the fractal structure from a fixated, real human eye. Moreover, the results demonstrated that data-averaging generally changes the structure of variation, introducing spurious structure into eye movement variability.",

      "abstractNote": "Background: Psycholinguistic error analysis of dyslexic responses in various reading tasks provides the primary basis for clinically discriminating subtypes of pathological reading. Within this framework, phonology-related errors are indicative of a sequential word processing strategy, whereas lexical and semantic errors are associated with a lexical reading strategy. Despite the large number of published intervention studies, relatively little is known about changes in error distributions during recovery in dyslexic patients. Aims: The main purpose of the present work was to extend the scope of research on the time course of recovery in readers with acquired dyslexia, using eye tracking methodology to examine word processing in real time. The guiding hypothesis was that in lexical readers a reduction of lexical errors and an emerging predominant production of phonological errors should be associated with a change to a more segmental momentto-moment reading behaviour.\nMethods & Procedures: Five patients participated in an eye movement supported reading intervention, where both lexical and segmental reading was facilitated. Reading performance was assessed before (T1) and after (T2) therapy intervention via recording of eye movements. Analyses included a novel way to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of processing using distributions of fixation positions as different time intervals. These subdistributions reveal the gradual shifting of fixation positions during word processing, providing an adequate metric for objective classification of online reading strategies. Outcome & Results: Therapy intervention led to improved reading accuracy in all subjects. In three of five participants, analyses revealed a restructuring in the underlying reading mechanisms from predominantly lexical to more segmental word processing. In contrast, two subjects maintained their lexical reading procedures. Importantly, the fundamental assumption that a high number of phonologically based reading errors must be associated with segmental word processing routines, while the production of lexical errors is indicative of a holistic reading strategy could not be verified.\nConclusions: Our results indicate that despite general improvements in reading performance, only some patients reorganised their word identification process.

Word frequency and word length effects were found. All results were compared to regular reading. Thorough reading involved longer total reading times and more rereading, and resulted in higher comprehension scores. Skimming involved longer saccades, shorter average fixation durations, more word skipping, shorter total reading times evenly distributed across the page, and resulted in lower comprehension scores. Spell checking involved shorter saccades, longer average fixation durations, less word skipping, longer total reading times evenly distributed across the entire page, and resulted in lower comprehension scores. Replicating local effects shows that paragraphs maintain sufficient experimental rigor, while also enabling reading analyses from a global perspective. Compared to regular reading, thorough reading was more elaborate and less uniform, skimming was faster and more uniform, and spell checking was slower and more uniform.",

Fifty-one proficient readers read passages of varying complexity from the Gray Oral Reading Test, while their eye-movements were recorded. Participants also completed a large battery of tests assessing various components of reading comprehension ability (vocabulary size, decoding, phonological awareness, and experience with print), as well as general cognitive and executive skills. We used the Random Forests non-parametric regression technique to simultaneously estimate relative importance of all predictors. This method enabled us to trace the temporal engagement of individual predictors and entire predictor groups on eye-movements during reading, while avoiding the problems of model overfitting and collinearity, typical of parametric regression methods. Our findings both confirmed well-established results of prior research and pointed to a space of hypotheses that is as yet unexplored.",

      "abstractNote": "Theories of eye-movement control in reading should ultimately describe how differences in knowledge and cognitive abilities affect reading and comprehension. Current mathematical models of eye-movement control do not yet incorporate individual differences as a source of variation in reading, although developmental and group-difference effects have been studied. These models nonetheless provide an excellent foundation for describing and explaining how and why patterns of eye-movements differ across readers (e.g., Rayner, Chace, & Ashby, 2006). Our focus in this article is on two aspects of individual variation: global processing speed (e.g., Salthouse, 1996) and working-memory capacity (e.g., Just & Carpenter, 1992). Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2001), we tested the extent to which overall reading speed and working-memory capacity moderate the degree to which syntactic and semantic information affect fixation times. Previous published data (Traxler et al., 2005) showed that working memory capacity and syntactic complexity interacted to determine fixation times in an eye-movement monitoring experiment. In a new set of models based on this same data set, we found that working-memory capacity interacted with sentence-characteristic variables only when processing speed was not included in the model. We interpret these findings with respect to current accounts of sentence processing and suggest how they might be incorporated into eyemovement control models.",

      "abstractNote": "Insight is an important cognitive process in creative thinking. The present research applied embodied cognitive perspective to explore the effect of embodied guidance on insight problem solving and its underlying mechanisms by two experiments. Experiment 1 used the matchstick arithmetic problem to explore the role of embodied gestures guidance in problem solving. The results showed that the embodied gestures facilitate the participants’ performance. Experiment 2 investigated how embodied attention guidance affects insight problem solving. The results showed that participants performed better in prototypical guidance condition. Experiment 2a adopted the Duncker’s radiation problem to explore how embodied behavior and prototypical guidance inﬂuence problem solving by attention tracing techniques. Experiment 2b aimed to further examine whether implicit attention transfer was the real cause which resulted in participants over-performing in prototypical guidance condition in Experiment 2a. The results demonstrated that overt physical motion was unnecessary for individuals to experience the beneﬁts of embodied guidance in problem solving, which supported the reciprocal relation hypothesis of saccades and attention. In addition, the questionnaire completed after experiments showed that participants did not realize the relation between guidance and insight problem solving. Taken together, the current study provided further evidence for that embodied gesture and embodied attention both facilitated the insight problem solving and the facilitation is implicit.",

We did so by presenting short texts—that conﬁrmed or disconﬁrmed verb-based implicit causality expectations—to two types of readers: proactive readers (long saccades, many regressions) and conservative readers (short saccades, few regressions). Whereas proactive readers used implicit causality information to predict upcoming referents, and slowed down immediately when they encountered a pronoun that was inconsistent with these verb-based expectations, the conservative readers slowed down much later in the sentence. These ﬁndings were consistent with the predictions of the risky reading hypothesis and as such presented novel evidence for the general idea that the eye-movement proﬁle of readers reveals valuable information about their processing strategy.",

More speci cally, in contrast to the traditional view that denigrates the bodily even while elevating the body, I aim to make sense of dancers’ embodied aesthetic experience of their own movements, as well as observers’ embodied aesthetic experience of seeing bodies move.",

      "abstractNote": "The aesthetic tradition has identified as paradigmatically sublime such objects as imposing mountains and intense storms, as well as monumental art. But the tradition also acknowledges less paradigmatic cases, including sometimes mathematical structures or abstract concepts. In this paper, we argue that there is also a case for considering phenomenal consciousness – the experiential quality of subjective awareness – as a sublime phenomenon. One appreciates this, we argue, when one is struck by (fitting) awe upon contemplating (a) the perplexing existence of something like phenomenal consciousness in an otherwise completely material universe and (b) the role of consciousness in injecting meaning and value in an otherwise brutally factual reality.",

      "abstractNote": "Humans all around the world are drawn to creating and consuming art due to its capability to evoke emotions, but the mechanisms underlying art-evoked feelings remain poorly characterised. Here we show how embodiement contributes to emotions evoked by a large database of visual art pieces (n = 336). In four experiments, we mapped the subjective feeling space of art-evoked emotions (n = 244), quantiﬁed “bodily ﬁngerprints” of these emotions (n = 615), and recorded the subjects’ interest annotations (n = 306) and eye movements (n = 21) while viewing the art. We show that art evokes a wide spectrum of feelings, and that the bodily ﬁngerprints triggered by art are central to these feelings, especially in artworks where human ﬁgures are salient. Altogether these results support the model that bodily sensations are central to the aesthetic experience.",

      "abstractNote": "This article considers human-autonomy teams (HATs) in which two human team members interact and collaborate with an autonomous teammate to achieve a common task while dealing with unexpected technological failures that were imposed either in automation or autonomy. A Wizard of Oz methodology is used to simulate the autonomous teammate. One of the critical aspects of HAT performance is the trust that develops over time as team members interact with each other in a dynamic task environment. For this reason, it is important to examine the dynamic nature of teammate trust through real-time measures of team interactions. This article examines team interaction and trust to understand better how they change under automation and autonomy failures. Thus, we address two research questions: 1) How does trust in HATs evolve over time?; and 2) How is the relationship between team interaction and trust impacted by the failures? We hypothesize that trust in HATs will decrease as autonomy failures increase. We also hypothesize that team interaction would be related to the development of trust and recovery from the failures. The results implicate three general trends: 1) team interaction dynamics are linked to the development of trust in HATs; 2) trust in the autonomous teammate is only associated with recovery from autonomy failures; 3) team interaction dynamics are related to both automation and autonomy failure recovery.",

      "abstractNote": "By its very nature, much of teamwork is distributed across, and not stored within, interdependent people working toward a common goal. In this light, we advocate a systems perspective on teamwork that is based on general coordination principles that are not limited to cognitive, motor, and physiological levels of explanation within the individual. In this article, we present a framework for understanding and modeling teams as dynamical systems and review our empirical ﬁndings on teams as dynamical systems. We proceed by (a) considering the question of why study teams as dynamical systems, (b) considering the meaning of dynamical systems concepts (attractors; perturbation; synchronization; fractals) in the context of teams, (c) describe empirical studies of team coordination dynamics at the perceptual-motor, cognitive-behavioral, and cognitive-neurophysiological levels of analysis, and (d) consider the theoretical and practical implications of this approach, including new kinds of explanations of human performance and real-time analysis and performance modeling. Throughout our discussion of the topics we consider how to describe teamwork using equations and/or modeling techniques that describe the dynamics. Finally, we consider what dynamical equations and models do and do not tell us about human performance in teams and suggest future research directions in this area.",

      "abstractNote": "Team coordination consists of both the dynamics of team member interaction and the environmental dynamics to which a team is subjected. Focusing on dynamics, an approach is developed that contrasts with traditional aggregate-static concepts of team coordination as characterized by the shared mental model approach. A team coordination order parameter was developed to capture momentary fluctuations in coordination. Team coordination was observed in three-person uninhabited air vehicle teams across two experimental sessions. The dynamics of the order parameter were observed under changes of a team familiarity control parameter. Team members returned for the second session to either the same (Intact) or different (Mixed) team. “Roadblock” perturbations, or novel changes in the task environment, were introduced in order to probe the stability of team coordination. Nonlinear dynamic methods revealed differences that a traditional approach did not: Intact and Mixed team coordination dynamics looked very different; Mixed teams were more stable than Intact teams and explored the space of solutions without the need for correction. Stability was positively correlated with the number of roadblock perturbations that were overcome successfully. The novel and non-intuitive contribution of a dynamical analysis was that Mixed teams, who did not have a long history working together, were more adaptive. Team coordination dynamics carries new implications for traditional problems such as training adaptive teams.",

Inspired by the current zeitgeist in cognitive science, as well as by empirical data and pragmatic concerns, we offer an alternative theory of team cognition. Interactive Team Cognition (ITC) theory posits that (1) team cognition is an activity, not a property or a product; (2) team cognition should be measured and studied at the team level; and (3) team cognition is inextricably tied to context. There are implications of ITC for theory building, modeling, measurement, and applications that make teams more effective performers.",

      "abstractNote": "Motor-respiratory coordination occurs naturally during exercise, but the number of coordination patterns performed between movement and breathing is limited. We investigated whether participants could acquire novel ratios (either 5:2 or 5:3). To examine complex temporal relationships between movement and breathing, we used lagged return plots that were produced by graphing relative phase against relative phase after a time delay. By the end of practice, participants performed 5:2 consistently and performed 5:3 using more stable ratios (3:2 and 2:1). Lagged return plots revealed that 5:3 learners harnessed the stable inphase and antiphase patterns to stabilize the required ratio. That strategy resulted in the performance of smaller-integer ratios in the production of 5:3 but not 5:2. Despite those differences, there was positive transfer to unpracticed ratios that was similar in both learning conditions. The time series analysis of lagged return plots revealed differences in ratio performance at transfer. Ratios whose component frequencies were farther apart, like 7:2, were performed consistently, while ratios whose component frequencies were more similar, like 5:4, elicited attraction to inphase and antiphase. The implication is that participants can combine more stable chunks of rhythmic behavior to produce more complex ratios. Ó 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The present study builds on work in team sciences to provide initial validation for a metric that quantifies CPS influence—the extent to which each individual contributes toward the team’s CPS processes—using average mutual information (AMI). The measure is investigated in teams collaborating in a computer programming task, where one teammate was assigned to a controller role (i.e., the only person who engaged with the task interface directly). Results suggest the controller had more influence over the team’s CPS processes than the other participants in the triad, providing initial validation for the influence metric. Future work will investigate the measure in classrooms and multiple modalities, and extend the metric in real-time to understand how influence fluctuates over the course of collaboration.",

      "abstractNote": "Objective: This review and synthesis examines approaches for measuring and assessing team coordination dynamics (TCD). The authors advance a system typology for classifying TCD approaches and their applications for increasing levels of dynamic complexity.\nBackground: There is an increasing focus on how teams adapt their coordination in response to changing and uncertain operational conditions. Understanding coordination is signiﬁcant because poor coordination is associated with maladaptive responses, whereas adaptive coordination is associated with effective responses. This issue has been met with TCD approaches that handle increasing complexity in the types of TCD teams exhibit.\nMethod: A three-level system typology of TCD approaches for increasing dynamic complexity is provided, with examples of research at each level. For System I TCD, team states converge toward a stable, ﬁxed-point attractor. For System II TCD, team states are periodic, which can appear complex, yet are regular and relatively stable. In System III TCD, teams can exhibit periodic patterns, but those patterns change continuously to maintain effectiveness.\nResults: System I and System II are applicable to TCD with known or discoverable behavioral attractors that are stationary across mid-to long-range timescales. System III TCD is the most generalizable to dynamic environments with high requirements for adaptive coordination across a range of timescales.\nConclusion: We outline current challenges for TCD and next steps in this burgeoning ﬁeld of research. Application: System III approaches are becoming widespread, as they are generalizable to time- and/or scale-varying TCD and multimodal analyses. Recommendations for deploying TCD in team settings are provided.",

      "abstractNote": "Reading speed is commonly used as an index of reading fluency. However, reading speed is not a consistent predictor of text comprehension, when speed and comprehension are measured on the same text within the same reader. This might be due to the somewhat ambiguous nature of reading speed, which is sometimes regarded as a feature of the reading process, and sometimes as a product of that process. We argue that both reading speed and comprehension should be seen as the result of the reading process, and that the process of fluent text reading can instead be described by complexity metrics that quantify aspects of the stability of the reading process. In this article, we introduce complexity metrics in the context of reading and apply them to data from a self-paced reading study. In this study, children and adults read a text silently or aloud and answered comprehension questions after reading. Our results show that recurrence metrics that quantify the degree of temporal structure in reading times yield better prediction of text comprehension compared to reading speed. However, the results for fractal metrics are less clear. Furthermore, prediction of text comprehension is generally strongest and most consistent across silent and oral reading when comprehension scores are normalized by reading speed. Analyses of word length and word frequency indicate that the observed complexity in reading times is not a simple function of the lexical properties of the text, suggesting that text reading might work differently compared to reading of isolated word or sentences.",

      "abstractNote": "Self-explanations are commonly used to assess on-line reading comprehension processes. However, traditional methods of analysis ignore important temporal variations in these explanations. This study investigated how dynamical systems theory could be used to reveal linguistic patterns that are predictive of self-explanation quality. High school students (n = 232) generated self-explanations while they read a science text. Recurrence Plots were generated to show qualitative differences in students’ linguistic sequences that were later quantified by indices derived by Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). To predict self-explanation quality, RQA indices, along with summative measures (i.e., number of words, mean word length, and type-token ration) and general reading ability, served as predictors in a series of regression models. Regression analyses indicated that recurrence in students’ self-explanations significantly predicted human rated self-explanation quality, even after controlling for summative measures of self-explanations, individual differences, and the text that was read (R2 = 0.68). These results demonstrate the utility of RQA in exposing and quantifying temporal structure in student’s self-explanations. Further, they imply that dynamical systems methodology can be used to uncover important processes that occur during comprehension.",

      "abstractNote": "Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system’s behaviour in phase space. A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980’s. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantiﬁcation of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system’s behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own ﬁeld of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difﬁculties and pitfalls.",

      "abstractNote": "Complex systems often exhibit amazingly regular behavior through allometry relations (ARs) between their functional attributes and their size. An empirical allometry relation (EAR) between two properties of a complex system relates the average functionality [Formula: see text] and the average size [Formula: see text][Formula: see text] = a[Formula: see text] where the allometry coefficient a and allometry exponent b are empirical constants fit to data. This EAR is a static relation and is found in every sub-discipline of Natural History. Herein we establish, both empirically and theoretically, that for some classes of evolving technology systems, the empirical allometry coefficient a is not constant, but is strongly dependent on the historical time at which the technology system originated. Specifically, we construct an EAR with a time-dependent coefficient, using the evolution of a broad class of military systems, over the last ten centuries, ranging from a medieval bowman to a modern rifleman, from a horse-drawn cannon to a tank. This time-dependent EAR is derived from fundamental considerations involving complexity, scaling, and renormalization group theory. The theory entails an information as well as complexity generalization of the traditional allometry coefficient that combines system size with the technology knowledge of the new system’s developers (time-dependence). It relates technology ARs to technology evolution relations, such as Moore’s Law, with implications for technology drawn from biological evolution analysis.",

Moreover, multistability spans (at least) the domains of action and perception, and has been found to place constraints upon, even dictating the nature of, intentional change and the skill-learning process. This paper reviews some of the key evidence for multistability in the aforementioned areas, and illustrates how it has been measured, modelled and theoretically understood. It then suggests how multistability—when combined with essential aspects of coordination dynamics such as instability, transitions and (especially) metastability—provides a platform for understanding coupling and the creative dynamics of complex goal-directed systems, including the brain and the brain–behaviour relation.",

      "abstractNote": "What we know about infant learning and memory is founded largely on systematic studies by the late Carolyn Rovee-Collier (1942–2014) and her associates of a phenomenon called mobile conjugate reinforcement. Experiments show that when a ribbon is attached from a 3-month-old infant’s foot to a mobile suspended overhead the baby quickly realizes it can make the mobile move. The mobile, which offers interesting sights and sounds, responds conjugately to the baby’s vigorous kicks which increase in rate by a factor of 3–4. In this paper, using the concepts, methods and tools of coordination dynamics, we present a theoretical model which reproduces the experimental observations of Rovee-Collier and others and predicts a number of additional features that can be experimentally tested. The model is a dynamical system consisting of three equations, one for the baby’s leg movements, one for the jiggling motion of the mobile and one for the functional coupling between the two. A key mechanism in the model is positive feedback which is shown to depend sensitively on bifurcation parameters related to the infant’s level of attention and inertial properties of the mobile. The implications of our model for the dynamical (and developmental) origins of agency are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Whereas sudden gains and losses (large shifts in symptom severity) in patients receiving psychotherapy appear abrupt and hence may seem unexpected, hypotheses from complex-systems theory suggest that sudden gains and losses are actually preceded by certain early-warning signals (EWSs). We tested whether EWSs in patients’ daily self-ratings of the psychotherapeutic process predicted future sudden gains and losses. Data were collected from 328 patients receiving psychotherapy for mood disorders who completed daily self-ratings about their therapeutic process using the Therapy Process Questionnaire (TPQ). Sudden gains and losses were classified from the Problem Intensity scale of the TPQ. The other items of the TPQ were used to compute the EWSs. EWSs predicted an increased probability for sudden gains and losses in a 4-day predictive window. These results show that EWSs can be used for real-time prediction of sudden gains and losses in clinical practice.",

      "abstractNote": "Movies offer viewers a broad range of emotional experiences, providing entertainment, and meaning. Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we reviewed the literature on digital systems designed to help users search and browse movie libraries and offer recommendations based on emotional content. Our search yielded 83 eligible documents (published between 2000 and 2021). We identified 22 case studies, 34 empirical studies, 26 proof of concept, and one theoretical paper. User transactions (e.g., ratings, tags) were the preferred source of information. The documents examined approached emotions from both a categorical (\n              \n                \n                  n\n                  =\n                  35\n                \n              \n              ) and dimensional (\n              \n                \n                  n\n                  =\n                  18\n                \n              \n              ) perspectives, and nine documents offer a combination of both approaches. Although there are several authors mentioned, the references used are frequently dated, and 12 documents do not mention author or model used. We identified 61 words related to emotion or affect. Documents presented on average 1.36 positive terms and 2.64 negative terms. Sentiment analysis (\n              \n                \n                  n\n                  =\n                  31\n                \n              \n              ) is frequently used for emotion identification, followed by subjective evaluations (\n              \n                \n                  n\n                  =\n                  15\n                \n              \n              ), movie low-level audio and visual features (n = 11), and face recognition technologies (\n              \n                \n                  n\n                  =\n                  8\n                \n              \n              ).

      "abstractNote": "With the latest technological developments, art has been reproduced and used in numerous ways. Pieces of art are not only present in museums, but also in advertisements and on products. This presence has proven its effectiveness in terms of how the product and/or how the brand are perceived. Art’s effect on product evaluation is called the art infusion effect, as the qualities of art are transferred onto the product. Even though there are various studies on art infusion, little is known about art’s impact when displayed on promotional event posters. A between-subjects experiment with 158 participants was conducted in order to see if events advertised on posters that include art are more positively evaluated than events advertised on posters that do not contain art. Moreover, it was examined if people have a higher general aesthetic experience (moderated by openness) when confronted with the art posters vs. the non-art ones, and if this aesthetic experience mediates event evaluation. The findings show that, firstly, there is no difference in general aesthetic experience when seeing posters with or without art. Secondly, contrary to the expected results, people evaluated the events seen on posters that did not contain classical art more positively. Finally, when taking all the variables into account, the complete model showed no significant moderated mediation. Summarizing, it is suggested that for event promotions posters should include photos rather than classical art. Further research could be done in relation to art infusion in event promotion, as the event type and the context in which the poster is placed both matter. Limitations, implications and suggestions for further research are also discussed.",

The present study explored how often people report such experiences and what people who often experience them are like. After noting which domain of the arts they encountered most often in daily life, young adults (n ϭ 188) rated how often they experienced aesthetic chills and related states. Latent variable models suggested three latent factors—aesthetic chills, feeling touched, and absorption—that shared a higher-order factor. As expected, people high in openness to experience and expertise in the arts consistently reported experiencing aesthetic chills more often. The Big Five personality factors accounted for about half of the variance, whereas cognitive and demographic variables were relatively unimportant. The individualdifferences approach thus seems like a promising complement to experimental work on aesthetic chills.",

      "abstractNote": "The concept of agency has been central to ecological approaches to psychology. Gibson, one of the founders of this movement, made room for this concept by arguing against the mechanistic conceptions in psychology. In his view, the environment is not a collection of causes that pushes the animal around, but consist of action possibilities, which he coined affordances. In making their way in the world, animals regulate their behavior with respect to these possibilities. Reed later developed this ecological conception of agency, following Gibson in conceiving of affordances as action possibilities. However, drawing upon industrial design, architecture, and phenomenology, we argue that affordances are not mere action possibilities but that they can also invite behavior. We suggest a mutualist perspective on invitations, suggesting that they depend on the animal–environment relationship in multiple dimensions. The implications of this new conception of affordances for the ecological account of agency are explored.",

From the 1990s, we show how movement coordination can be used to probe the brain of individual subjects and how coordination patterns in behavior are also manifested in brain signals. From the 2000s, we present an experiment on social coordination in brain and behavior and introduce an analysis technique for EEG signals recorded in such settings. Most recently, we recorded the performance of a professional ballet dancer, where we found the coordination patterns of in-phase and anti-phase as elementary building blocks in complex movements.",

      "abstractNote": "While it has extensively been argued that aesthetic categories such as beauty have a direct relationship to emotion, there has only been limited psychological research on the relationship between aesthetic judgments and emotional responses to art. Music is recognized to be an art form that elicits strong emotional responses in listeners and it is therefore pertinent to study empirically how aesthetic judgments relate to emotional responses to music listening. The aim of the presented study is to test for the impact of aesthetic judgment on various psychophysiological response measures of emotion that were assessed in parallel in two contemporary music concerts, each with a different audience and program. In order to induce different levels of aesthetic judgments in participants, we assigned them randomly to one of two groups in a between-subjects design in both concerts: One group attended a talk on the music presented, illustrating its aesthetic value, while the other group attended an unrelated talk on a non-musical topic. During the concerts, we assessed, from 41 participants in Concert 1 (10 males; mean age 23 years) and 53 in Concert 2 (14 males; mean age 24 years), different emotional response components: (a) retrospective rating of emotion; (b) activation of the peripheral nervous system (skin conductance and heart rate); (c) the activity of two facial muscles associated with emotional valence (only Concert 1). Participants listened to live performances of a selection of contemporary music pieces. After each piece, participants rated the music according to a list of commonly discussed aesthetic judgment criteria, all thought to contribute to the perceived aesthetic value of art. While preconcert talks did not signiﬁcantly impact value judgment ratings, through factor analyses it was found that aesthetic judgments could be grouped into several underlying dimensions representing analytical, semantic, traditional aesthetic, and typicality values. All dimensions where then subsequently shown to be related to subjective and physiological responses to music. The ﬁndings reported in this study contribute to understanding the relationship between aesthetic judgment processes and emotional responses to music. The results give further evidence that cognitive-affective interactions have a signiﬁcant role in processing music stimuli.",

As expected, the personality trait openness to experience was the strongest and only consistent personality correlate of artistic preferences, affecting both overall and specific preferences, as well as visits to galleries, and artistic (rather than scientific) self‐perception. Overall preferences were also positively influenced by age and visits to art galleries, and to a lesser degree, by artistic self‐perception and conscientiousness (negatively). As for specific styles, after overall preferences were accounted for, more agreeable, more conscientious and less open individuals reported higher preference levels for impressionist, younger and more extraverted participants showed higher levels of preference for cubism (as did males), and younger participants, as well as males, reported higher levels of preferences for renaissance. Limitations and recommendations for future research are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Our emotional responses are determined not only by actual experience, but also by anticipation. Indeed, we respond not only to anticipations per se, but to the relation between anticipations and experiences. Such anticipations operate on different time scales, linked with distinct neurological substrates. Some—such as those involving expectations about the immediate trajectory of objects—are very brief. The relations between experience and very short-term expectations can have significant emotional consequences. One purpose of the standard continuity editing system is to avoid disruptions in our short-term projections. However, the manipulation of discontinuities, thus the controlled disruption of short-term anticipations, can significantly contribute to the emotional impact of film. It is possible to isolate distinct varieties of anticipation and disruption, examining their emotional consequences in different cases. Muzaffar Ali’s Umrao Jaan provides a virtual catalogue of such disruptions and their emotional effects.",

      "abstractNote": "This article investigates the effects of films on an audience, using an interdisciplinary empirical approach connecting film analysis and psychophysiological measurement. It discusses the animated short film Father and Daughter (2000) directed by Michael Dudok de Wit. The features of the film that are relevant to the reception process, the so-called moments of narrative impact, are determined on the basis of Wuss’s analytical film model. The model postulates that films can be described as a combination of different kinds of narrative structures that predetermine the reception, which is conceptualized as a process of problem solving. This article defines five moments of narrative impact. Three of these moments establish the main conflict and its possible solution while the other two combine reoccurring motives, the socalled topic lines. Heart rate and skin conductance reactions were examined for thirty participants. The results of heart rate measurements demonstrate a clear significance for a combination of topic lines. The establishment of the central conflict also evokes significant reactions.",

      "abstractNote": "Humans, and many non-human animals, produce and respond to harsh, unpredictable, nonlinear sounds when alarmed, possibly because these are produced when acoustic production systems (vocal cords and syrinxes) are overblown in stressful, dangerous situations. Humans can simulate nonlinearities in music and soundtracks through the use of technological manipulations. Recent work found that film soundtracks from different genres differentially contain such sounds. We designed two experiments to determine specifically how simulated nonlinearities in soundtracks influence perceptions of arousal and valence. Subjects were presented with emotionally neutral musical exemplars that had neither noise nor abrupt frequency transitions, or versions of these musical exemplars that had noise or abrupt frequency upshifts or downshifts experimentally added. In a second experiment, these acoustic exemplars were paired with benign videos. Judgements of both arousal and valence were altered by the addition of these simulated nonlinearities in the first, music-only, experiment. In the second, multi-modal, experiment, valence (but not arousal) decreased with the addition of noise or frequency downshifts. Thus, the presence of a video image suppressed the ability of simulated nonlinearities to modify arousal. This is the first study examining how nonlinear simulations in music affect emotional judgements. These results demonstrate that the perception of potentially fearful or arousing sounds is influenced by the perceptual context and that the addition of a visual modality can antagonistically suppress the response to an acoustic stimulus.",

      "abstractNote": "The origins of music and musical emotions is still an enigma, here I propose a comprehensive hypothesis on the origins and evolution of music, dance, and speech from a biological and sociological perspective. I suggest that every pitch interval between neighboring notes in music represents corresponding movement pattern through interpreting the Doppler effect of sound, which not only provides a possible explanation for the transposition invariance of music, but also integrates music and dance into a common form—rhythmic movements. Accordingly, investigating the origins of music poses the question: why do humans appreciate rhythmic movements? I suggest that human appreciation of rhythmic movements and rhythmic events developed from the natural selection of organisms adapting to the internal and external rhythmic environments. The perception and production of, as well as synchronization with external and internal rhythms are so vital for an organism’s survival and reproduction, that animals have a rhythm-related reward and emotion (RRRE) system. The RRRE system enables the appreciation of rhythmic movements and events, and is integral to the origination of music, dance and speech. The ﬁrst type of rewards and emotions (rhythm-related rewards and emotions, RRREs) are evoked by music and dance, and have biological and social functions, which in turn, promote the evolution of music, dance and speech. These functions also evoke a second type of rewards and emotions, which I name society-related rewards and emotions (SRREs). The neural circuits of RRREs and SRREs develop in species formation and personal growth, with congenital and acquired characteristics, respectively, namely music is the combination of nature and culture. This hypothesis provides probable selection pressures and outlines the evolution of music, dance, and speech. The links between the Doppler effect and the RRREs and SRREs can be empirically tested, making the current hypothesis scientiﬁcally concrete.",

      "abstractNote": "Using Robin Dunbar’s theories about hominin social bonding and the evolution of music, dance and religion, this article argues that a proto-ritualistic collective song and dance performance established conditions that were ideal for the evolution of fundamental elements of human cognition, such as shared intentionality, joint attention, and the ability to form a mental template. Furthermore, it is argued that this dance routine would have been an effective breeding ground for the development of a psychological regulatory system that could powerfully enforce cooperation by collectively targeting individuals who do not or cannot conform to the melody or the beat – i.e. misfits who do not achieve synchrony with the other members of the dance group. Thus a hominin society consisting of highly cooperative individuals possessing the cognitive skills of shared intentionality, joint attention, and the ability to form mental templates – i.e. a society with all the necessary skills for the development of a mimetic form of communication, followed much later by spoken language – comes into being.",

      "abstractNote": "Despite evolutionary musicology’s interdisciplinary nature, and the diverse methods it employs, the ﬁeld has nevertheless tended to divide into two main positions. Some argue that music should be understood as a naturally selected adaptation, while others claim that music is a product of culture with little or no relevance for the survival of the species. We review these arguments, suggesting that while interesting and well-reasoned positions have been offered on both sides of the debate, the nature-or-culture (or adaptation vs. non-adaptation) assumptions that have traditionally driven the discussion have resulted in a problematic either/or dichotomy. We then consider an alternative “biocultural” proposal that appears to offer a way forward. As we discuss, this approach draws on a range of research in theoretical biology, archeology, neuroscience, embodied and ecological cognition, and dynamical systems theory (DST), positing a more integrated model that sees biological and cultural dimensions as aspects of the same evolving system. Following this, we outline the enactive approach to cognition, discussing the ways it aligns with the biocultural perspective. Put simply, the enactive approach posits a deep continuity between mind and life, where cognitive processes are explored in terms of how self-organizing living systems enact relationships with the environment that are relevant to their survival and well-being. It highlights the embodied and ecologically situated nature of living agents, as well as the active role they play in their own developmental processes. Importantly, the enactive approach sees cognitive and evolutionary processes as driven by a range of interacting factors, including the socio-cultural forms of activity that characterize the lives of more complex creatures such as ourselves. We offer some suggestions for how this approach might enhance and extend the biocultural model. To conclude we brieﬂy consider the implications of this approach for practical areas such as music education.",

      "abstractNote": "I deal with perception and action (e.g., movements) using results from synergetics, a comprehensive mathematical theory of the self-organized formation (emergence) of spatial, temporal, or functional structures in complex systems. I illustrate basic concepts such as order parameters (OPs), enslavement, complexity reduction, circular causality ﬁrst by examples of well-known collective, spontaneous modes of human behavior such as rhythmic clapping of hands, and so forth, and then by face recognition. The role played by OPs depends on context. In the case of face (or pattern) recognition an OP represents the concept of an individual face (action of mind) and it enslaves the action (ﬁring rates) of neurons (body). This insight allows me to interpret syndromes as order parameters playing their mind/body double role. I present criteria for the identiﬁcation of OPs and discuss their general properties including error correction and remedy of deﬁciencies. Contact is made with a recent paper by Sabine Koch on embodied aesthetics. My approach includes the saturation of attention at various time scales (ambiguous ﬁgures/fashion). Adopting a psychological perspective, I discuss some ingredients of beauty such as proportionality and symmetry, but also the importance of irregularities.",

Past research has demonstrated that the behavioral synchronization involved in social interactions is similar to dynamical synchronization found generically in nature. The present study investigated how the bodily synchronization in a joke telling task is spread across different nested temporal scales. Pairs of participants enacted knock–knock jokes and times series of their bodily activity were recorded. Coherence and relative phase analyses were used to evaluate the synchronization of bodily rhythms for the whole trial as well as at the subsidiary time scales of the whole joke, the setup of the punch line, the two-person exchange and the utterance. The analyses revealed greater than chance entrainment of the joke teller’s and joke responder’s movements at all time scales and that the relative phasing of the teller’s movements led those of the responder at the longer time scales. Moreover, this entrainment was greater when visual information about the partner’s movements was present but was decreased particularly at the shorter time scales when explicit gesturing in telling the joke was performed. In short, the results demonstrate that a complex interpersonal bodily “dance” occurs during structured conversation interactions and that this “dance” is constructed from a set of rhythms associated with the nested behavioral structure of the interaction.",

We have shown that otherwise healthy, unmedicated patients with these disorders display reduced resting-state HRV, and that pharmacological treatments do not ameliorate these reductions. Other studies highlight that tricyclic medications and the serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors in particular may have adverse cardiovascular consequences. Reduced HRV has important functional signiﬁcance for motivation to engage social situations, social approach behaviours, self-regulation and psychological ﬂexibility in the face of stressors. Over the longer-term, reduced HRV leads to immune dysfunction and inﬂammation, cardiovascular disease and mortality, attributable to the downstream effects of a poorly functioning cholinergic anti-inﬂammatory reﬂex. We place our research in the context of the broader literature base and propose a working model for the effects of mood disorders, comorbid conditions, and their treatments to help guide future research activities. Further research is urgently needed on the long-term effects of autonomic dysregulation in otherwise healthy psychiatric patients, and appropriate interventions to halt the progression of a host of conditions associated with morbidity and mortality.",

Three crucial characteristics of aesthetic experience are discussed: fascination with an aesthetic object (high arousal and attention), appraisal of the symbolic reality of an object (high cognitive engagement), and a strong feeling of unity with the object of aesthetic fascination and aesthetic appraisal. In a proposed model, two parallel levels of aesthetic information processing are proposed. On the ﬁrst level two sub-levels of narrative are processed, story (theme) and symbolism (deeper meanings). The second level includes two sub-levels, perceptual associations (implicit meanings of object’s physical features) and detection of compositional regularities. Two sub-levels are deﬁned as crucial for aesthetic experience, appraisal of symbolism and compositional regularities. These sub-levels require some speciﬁc cognitive and personality dispositions, such as expertise, creative thinking, and openness to experience. Finally, feedback of emotional processing is included in our model: appraisals of everyday emotions are speciﬁed as a matter of narrative content (eg, empathy with characters), whereas the aesthetic emotion is deﬁned as an affective evaluation in the process of symbolism appraisal or the detection of compositional regularities.",

      "abstractNote": "Empathy is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that plays a crucial role in human social interactions. Recent developments in social neuroscience have provided valuable insights into the neural underpinnings and bodily mechanisms underlying empathy. This methodology often prioritizes precision, replicability, internal validity, and confound control. However, fully understanding the complexity of empathy seems unattainable by solely relying on artificial and controlled laboratory settings, while overlooking a comprehensive view of empathy through an ecological experimental approach. In this article, we propose articulating an integrative theoretical and methodological framework based on the 5E approach (the “E”s stand for\n              embodied, embedded, enacted, emotional, and extended perspectives of empathy\n              ), highlighting the relevance of studying empathy as an active interaction between embodied agents, embedded in a shared real-world environment. In addition, we illustrate how a novel multimodal approach including mobile brain and body imaging (MoBi) combined with phenomenological methods, and the implementation of interactive paradigms in a natural context, are adequate procedures to study empathy from the 5E approach. In doing so, we present the Empirical 5E approach (E5E) as an integrative scientific framework to bridge brain/body and phenomenological attributes in an interbody interactive setting. Progressing toward an E5E approach can be crucial to understanding empathy in accordance with the complexity of how it is experienced in the real world.",

      "abstractNote": "The new approach in cognitive science largely known as “4E cognition” (embodied/embedded/enactive/extended cognition), which sheds new light on the complex dynamics of human consciousness, seems to revive some of Aristotle's views. For instance, the concept of “nature” (\n              phusis\n              ) and the discussion on “active intellect” (\n              nous poiêtikos\n              ) may be particularly relevant in this respect. Out of the various definitions of “nature” in Aristotle's\n              Physics, On the Parts of Animals\n              and\n              Second Analytics\n              , I will concentrate on nature defined as an inner impulse to movement, neither entirely “corporeal,” nor entirely “incorporeal,” and neither entirely “substantial,” nor entirely “accidental.” Related to that, I will consider the distinction in\n              On the Soul\n              between the “active” and the “passive” intellect, which Aristotle asserted as generally present in “nature” itself. By offering a conceptual and historical analysis of these views, I intend to show how the mind–body problem, which is essential for the explanation of consciousness, could be somewhat either eluded or transcended by both ancients and contemporaries on the basis of a subtle account of causation. While not attempting to diminish the impact of the Cartesian paradigm, which led to the so-called “hard problem of consciousness,” I suggest that the most recent neuroscience discoveries on the neurophysiological phenomena related to human consciousness could be better explained and understood if interpreted within a 4E cognition paradigm, inspired by some Aristotelian views.",

Speciﬁcally, the study tested whether visual exploration mediated the inﬂuence of individual differences in personality and cognitive style on aesthetic responses. Fifty-six visitors to the gallery viewed seven artworks while their eye movements were recorded. Participants rated their aesthetic response to the artworks and wrote their thoughts and impressions about each artwork. Written reports were analyzed in terms of word count and frequency of use of aesthetic descriptors. Participants completed individual difference measures, including Openness to Experience [OTE] and Need for Cognitive Closure [NFC] before viewing artworks. The results showed that (a) the duration of looking at artworks (dwell time) mediated the relationship between OTE, NFC, and word count as well as the frequency of use of aesthetic descriptors, and (b) the spatial distribution of ﬁxations mediated the relationship between both OTE and NFC and the number of words used in response to viewing artworks. The results indicate that visual exploration plays a functional role in the experience of artworks in a real gallery setting, and that visual exploration is a mechanism through which OTE and NFC inﬂuence aesthetic responses.",

To examine the possible underlying mechanism mediating the effects of appeal on performance, participants were put in a positive or negative mood prior to carrying out a visual target localisation task with appealing and unappealing targets. Positive mood initially led to faster localisation of appealing compared to unappealing stimuli, while an advantage for appealing over unappealing stimuli emerged over time in negative mood participants. The findings are compatible with the idea that appealing stimuli may be inherently rewarding, with mood temporarily gating any rewarding effects that aesthetic appeal might have on performance. However, this gating by mood is temporary and aesthetic appeal help counteract the adverse effect of negative mood on performance.",

      "abstractNote": "Our theoretical model (Menninghaus et al., 2019) defines aesthetic emotions by reference to their role in aesthetic evaluation, and specifically as being predictive of aesthetic liking/disliking. Skov and Nadal (2020) dismiss the construct of “aesthetic emotions” as a “dated supposition” adopted from a “speculative” tradition and assert that there are no such emotions. Accordingly, they question all pieces of empirical evidence we referred to as supporting our model. In our response, we rebut these objections point by point and defend as well as expand the empirical evidence in support of our model.",

      "abstractNote": "Embodied cognition claims that how we move our body is central for experience. Exploring dimensions of bodily engagement should, therefore, also be central for engaging art. However, little attention has been paid to the actual ways viewers move in front of art and how this impacts experiences. We aim to close this gap, using a new paradigm in a gallery-like setting in which we tracked movements of participants that engaged an abstract artwork. Guided by a literature review, we relate objective movement factors and subjective body awareness to mobile viewing behavior, art experience, and expertise. We also—for the first time—define shared movement patterns employing principal component/cluster analysis and relate these to experience outcomes, noting, for example, that moving more/more dynamically related to more reported insight. As a proof-of-concept paper, we hope to support a more embodied, enactive understanding of art engagements, and provide practical guidelines for future research.",

      "abstractNote": "The study of emotional responses to art has remained curiously detached from the psychology of emotions. Historically, the leading tradition has been Daniel Berlyne's psychobiological model, embodied by the “new experimental aesthetics” movement of the 1970s. That theory explained hedonic qualities of art by referring to arousal-modifying “collative properties” of art, such as complexity, novelty, uncertainty, and conflict. Berlyne's influence on the experimental study of aesthetics has been enormous, largely for the better but also for the worse. Berlyne's suspicion of cognitive psychology led to an unproductive perseveration on arousal as the mechanism of “aesthetic responses.” This article describes how appraisal theories of emotion inform the study of aesthetics. Appraisal theories make new predictions about emotional responses to art, expand the domain of aesthetic emotions beyond positive emotions such as interest and enjoyment, inform other theories (e.g., prototypicality models), and reinterpret past findings.",

      "abstractNote": "The complexity matching effect refers to a maximization of information exchange, when interacting systems share similar complexities. Additionally, interacting systems tend to attune their complexities in order to enhance their coordination. This effect has been observed in a number of synchronization experiments, and interpreted as a transfer of multifractality between systems. Finally, it has been shown that when two systems of different complexity levels interact, this transfer of multifractality operates from the most complex system to the less complex, yielding an increase of complexity in the latter. This theoretical framework inspired the present experiment that tested the possible restoration of complexity in older people. In young and healthy participants, walking is known to present 1/f ﬂuctuations, reﬂecting the complexity of the locomotion system, providing walkers with both stability and adaptability. In contrast walking tends to present a more disordered dynamics in older people, and this whitening was shown to correlate with fall propensity. We hypothesized that if an aged participant walked in close synchrony with a young companion, the complexity matching effect should result in the restoration of complexity in the former. Older participants were involved in a prolonged training program of synchronized walking, with a young experimenter. Synchronization within the dyads was dominated by complexity matching. We observed a restoration of complexity in participants after 3 weeks, and this effect was persistent 2 weeks after the end of the training session. This work presents the ﬁrst demonstration of a restoration of complexity in deﬁcient systems.",

      "abstractNote": "We propose an expansion of neuroecological comparisons to include the capabilities of brainless and non-neural organisms. We begin this enterprise by conducting a systematic search for studies on learning in echinoderms. Echinodermata are marine invertebrates comprising starfish, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, and sea lilies. Animals in this phylum lack any centralized brain and instead possess diffuse neural networks known as nerve nets. The learning abilities of these animals are of particular interest as, within the bilaterian clade, they are close evolutionary neighbors to chordates, a phylum whose members exhibit complex feats in learning and contain highly specialized brains. The learning capacities and limitations of echinoderms can inform the evolution of nervous systems and learning in Bilateria. We find evidence of both non-associative and associative learning (in the form of classical conditioning) in echinoderms, which was primarily focused on starfish. Additional evidence of learning is documented in brittle stars, sand dollars, and sea urchins. We then discuss the evolutionary significance of learning capabilities without a brain, the presence of embodied cognition across multiple groups, and compare the learning present in echinoderms with the impressive cognitive abilities documented in the oldest linage group within vertebrates (the major group within the phylum of chordates), fish.",

      "abstractNote": "There is a growing body of research indicating that bodily sensation and behavior strongly inﬂuences one’s emotional reaction toward certain situations or objects. On this background, a framework model of embodied affectivity1 is suggested: we regard emotions as resulting from the circular interaction between affective qualities or affordances in the environment and the subject’s bodily resonance, be it in the form of sensations, postures, expressive movements or movement tendencies. Motion and emotion are thus intrinsically connected: one is moved by movement (perception; impression; affection2) and moved to move (action; expression; e-motion). Through its resonance, the body functions as a medium of emotional perception: it colors or charges self-experience and the environment with affective valences while it remains itself in the background of one’s own awareness. This model is then applied to emotional social understanding or interaffectivity which is regarded as an intertwinement of two cycles of embodied affectivity, thus continuously modifying each partner’s affective affordances and bodily resonance. We conclude with considerations of how embodied affectivity is altered in psychopathology and can be addressed in psychotherapy of the embodied self.",

      "abstractNote": "In mammals, maternal signals conveyed via influences on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity may shape behavior of the young to be better adapted for prevailing environmental conditions. However, the mother’s influence extends beyond classic stress response systems. In guinea pigs, several hours (h) of separation from the mother activates not only the HPA axis, but also the innate immune system, which effects immediate behavioral change, as well as modifies behavioral responsiveness in the future. Moreover, the presence of the mother potently suppresses the behavioral consequences of this innate immune activation. These findings raise the possibility that long-term adaptive behavioral change can be mediated by the mother’s influence on immune-related activity of her pups. Furthermore, the impact of social partners on physiological stress responses and their behavioral outcomes are not limited to the infantile period. A particularly crucial period for social development in male guinea pigs is that surrounding the attainment of sexual maturation. At this time, social interactions with adults can dramatically affect circulating cortisol concentrations and social behavior in ways that appear to prepare the male to best cope in its likely future social environment. Despite such multiple social influences on the behavior of guinea pigs at different ages, inter-individual differences in the magnitude of the cortisol response remain surprisingly stable over most of the life span. Together, it appears that throughout the life span, physiological stress responses may be regulated by social stimuli. These influences are hypothesized to adjust behavior for predicted environmental conditions. In addition, stable individual differences might provide a means of facilitating adaptation to less predictable conditions.",

The present study tested the hypothesis that destabilization is related to better treatment outcome.\nMethod: 328 patients who received psychotherapy for mood disorders completed daily self-ratings about their psychotherapeutic process. A continuous measure of destabilization was defined as the relative strength of the highest peak in dynamic complexity, a measure for variability and turbulence, in the self-ratings of individual patients.\nResults: Destabilization was found to be related to better treatment outcome. When improvers and non-improvers were analyzed separately, destabilization was found to be related to better treatment outcome in improvers but not in nonimprovers.\nConclusions: Destabilization in daily self-ratings of the psychotherapeutic process is associated with better treatment outcome. The identification of destabilization periods in process-monitoring data is clinically relevant. During destabilization, patients are believed to be increasingly sensitive to the effects of therapy. Clinicians could tailor their interventions to these sensitive periods.",

      "abstractNote": "Background: Psychopathology research is changing focus from group-based ‘disease models’ to a personalized approach inspired by complex systems theories. This approach, which has already produced novel and valuable insights into the complex nature of psychopathology, often relies on repeated self-ratings of individual patients. So far it has been unknown whether such self-ratings, the presumed observables of the individual patient as a complex system, actually display complex dynamics. We examine this basic assumption of a complex systems approach to psychopathology by testing repeated self-ratings for three markers of complexity: memory, the presence of (time-varying) short- and long-range temporal correlations, regime shifts, transitions between different dynamic regimes, and, sensitive dependence on initial conditions, also known as the ‘butterfly effect’, the divergence of initially similar trajectories.\nMethods: We analysed repeated self-ratings (1,476 time points) from a single patient for the three markers of complexity using Bartels rank test, (partial) autocorrelation functions, timevarying autoregression, a non-stationarity test, change point analysis and the Sugihara-May algorithm.\nResults: Self-ratings concerning psychological states (e.g., the item ‘I feel down’) exhibited all complexity markers: time-varying short- and long-term memory, multiple regime shifts and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Unexpectedly, self-ratings concerning physical sensations (e.g., the item ‘I am hungry’) exhibited less complex dynamics and their behaviour was more similar to random variables.\nConclusions: Psychological self-ratings display complex dynamics. The presence of complexity in repeated self-ratings means that we have to acknowledge that (1) repeated selfratings yield a complex pattern of data and not a set of (nearly) independent data points, (2)",

      "abstractNote": "The modern study of resilience in development is conceptually based on a complex adaptive system ontology in which many (intersystem) factors are involved in the emergence of resilient developmental pathways. However, the methods and models developed to study complex dynamical systems have not been widely adopted, and it has recently been noted this may constitute a problem moving the field forward. In the present paper, I argue that an ontological commitment to complex adaptive systems is not only possible, but highly recommended for the study of resilience in development. Such a commitment, however, also comes with a commitment to a different causal ontology and different research methods. In the first part of the paper, I discuss the extent to which current research on resilience in development conceptually adheres to the complex systems perspective. In the second part, I introduce conceptual tools that may help researchers conceptualize causality in complex systems. The third part discusses idiographic methods that could be used in a research program that embraces the interaction dominant causal ontology and idiosyncratic nature of the dynamics of complex systems. The conclusion is that a strong ontological commitment is warranted, but will require a radical departure from nomothetic science.",

To counter this assumption, in this paper we offer a radical embodied (non-representational) account of skilled action that combines ecological psychology and the Deweyan theory of habits. According to our proposal, skilful performance can be understood as composed of sequences of mutually coherent, task-specific perceptual-motor habits. Such habits play a crucial role in simplifying both our exploration of the perceptual environment and our decision-making. However, we argue that what keeps habits situated, precluding them from becoming rote and automatic, are not mental representations but the agent’s conscious attention to the affordances of the environment. It is because the agent is not acting on autopilot but constantly searching for new information for affordances that she can control her behavior, adapting previously learned habits to the current circumstances. We defend that our account provides the resources needed to understand how skilled action can be intelligent (flexible, adaptive, context-sensitive) without having any representational cognitive processes built into them.",

      "abstractNote": "Understanding habits at a biological level requires a combination of behavioral observations and measures of ongoing neural activity. Theoretical frameworks as well as deﬁnitions of habitual behaviors emerging from classic behavioral research have been enriched by new approaches taking account of the identiﬁcation of brain regions and circuits related to habitual behavior. Together, this combination of experimental and theoretical work has provided key insights into how brain circuits underlying actionlearning and action-selection are organized, and how a balance between behavioral ﬂexibility and ﬁxity is achieved. New methods to monitor and manipulate neural activity in real time are allowing us to have a ﬁrst look “under the hood” of a habit as it is formed and expressed. Here we discuss ideas emerging from such approaches. We pay special attention to the unexpected ﬁndings that have arisen from our own experiments suggesting that habitual behaviors likely require the simultaneous activity of multiple distinct components, or operators, seen as responsible for the contrasting dynamics of neural activity in both cortico-limbic and sensorimotor circuits recorded concurrently during different stages of habit learning. The neural dynamics identiﬁed thus far do not fully meet expectations derived from traditional models of the structure of habits, and the behavioral measures of habits that we have made also are not fully aligned with these models. We explore these new clues as opportunities to reﬁne an understanding of habits.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper argues that it is possible to combine enactivism and ecological psychology in a single post-cognitivist research framework if we highlight the common pragmatist assumptions of both approaches. These pragmatist assumptions or starting points are shared by ecological psychology and the enactive approach independently of being historically related to pragmatism, and they are based on the idea of organic coordination, which states that the evolution and development of the cognitive abilities of an organism are explained by appealing to the history of interactions of that organism with its environment. It is argued that the idea of behavioral or organic coordination within the enactive approach gives rise to the sensorimotor abilities of the organism, while the ecological approach emphasizes the coordination at a higher-level between organism and environment through the agent’s exploratory behavior for perceiving affordances. As such, these two different processes of organic coordination can be integrated in a postcognitivist research framework, which will be based on two levels of analysis: the subpersonal one (the neural dynamics of the sensorimotor contingencies and the emergence of enactive agency) and the personal one (the dynamics that emerges from the organism-environment interaction in ecological terms). If this proposal is on the right track, this may be a promising first step for offering a systematized and consistent postcognitivist approach to cognition that retain the full potential of both enactivism and ecological psychology.",

      "abstractNote": "According to the free energy principle all living systems aim to minimise free energy in their sensory exchanges with the environment. Processes of free energy minimisation are thus ubiquitous in the biological world. Indeed it has been argued that even plants engage in free energy minimisation. Not all living things however feel alive. How then did the feeling of being alive get started? In line with the arguments of the phenomenologists, I will claim that every feeling must be felt by someone. It must have mineness built into it if it is to feel a particular way. The question I take up in this paper asks how mineness might have arisen out of processes of free energy minimisation, given that many systems that keep themselves alive lack mineness. The hypothesis I develop in this paper is that the life of an organism can be seen as an inferential process. Every living system embodies a probability distribution conditioned on a model of the sensory, physiological, and morphological states that are highly probably given the life it leads and the niche it inhabits. I argue for an ecological and enactive interpretation of free energy. I show how once the life of an organism reaches a certain level of complexity mineness emerges as an intrinsic part of the process of life itself.",

      "abstractNote": "Health behaviors, such as physical exercise, are associated with chronic diseases that top the list of all-cause mortality. Yet, the most healthful lifestyle changes people can (and often want to) make, also tend to be the most challenging to sustain. This dissertation explores how modeling behavior as a dynamical system could improve understanding of psychological processes that sustain behavioral changes. I focus on two classes of processes—motivational and habitual—that may be most pertinent to sustaining changes in physical exercise. A model based on prior theorizing is constructed and simulated (Study 1), and observational data are analyzed (Study 2). Intensive longitudinal data are collected from healthy US-based Fitbit users who recently initiated an increase in exercise. Participants are prospectively observed for two months during which measures of motivation and habit are assessed three days per week, and exerciseas-usual is passively tracked via Fitbit. I find that within-person increases in the automaticity with which exercise is performed in a given week is associated with increases in time spent exercising. Furthermore, differences in the trajectory of automaticity and satisfaction with exercise over time may differentiate those who successfully maintain increases in exercise and those who do not. Results are placed in the context of contemporary theories of behavior change maintenance and suggestions for improvement are forwarded.",

In attempting to explain how this integration takes place, I’ll consider two possible approaches: predictive processing (PP) and enactivism. I’ll argue that PP, which, on a neuroscientific view, conceives of the mind as set up to avoid surprise, will not be able to explain improvisation if it remains true to its own principles. In contrast, I’ll argue, enactivism, as a form of embodied cognition that takes the explanatory unit to be the brain-body environment, can offer a better explanation of improvisation. I’ll also argue that the notion of habit is central to this account.",

      "abstractNote": "Healthy brain functioning depends on balancing stable integration between brain areas for effective coordinated functioning, with bursts of desynchronisation to allow subsystems to reconfigure and express functional specialisation. Metastability, a concept originated in statistical physics and dynamical systems theory, has been proposed as a key signature that characterises this balance. Building on this principle, the neuroscience literature has employed markers of metastability to investigate various aspects of brain function including cognitive performance, healthy ageing, meditation, sleep, responses to pharmacological challenges, and to characterise psychiatric conditions or disorders of consciousness. However, this body of work often uses the notion of metastability heuristically, and sometimes inaccurately, making it hard for the uninitiated to navigate the vast literature, interpret findings, and foster further development of theoretical and experimental methodologies. In this paper we provide a comprehensive review of metastability and its applications in neuroscience, covering its scientific and historical foundations and the practical estimators used to estimate it in empirical data. We also provide a critical analysis of recent theoretical developments, clarifying common misconceptions and paving the road for future developments.",

      "abstractNote": "Despite resting state networks being associated with a variety of cognitive abilities, it remains unclear how these local areas act in concert to express particular cognitive operations. Theoretical and empirical accounts indicate that large-scale resting state networks reconcile dual tendencies towards integration and segregation by operating in a metastable regime of their coordination dynamics. Metastability may confer important behavioural qualities by binding distributed local areas into large-scale neurocognitive networks. We tested this hypothesis by analysing fMRI data in a large cohort of healthy individuals (N = 566) and comparing the metastability of the brain's large-scale resting network architecture at rest and during the performance of several tasks. Metastability was estimated using a well-defined collective variable capturing the level of 'phase-locking' between large-scale networks over time. Task-based reasoning was principally characterised by high metastability in cognitive control networks and low metastability in sensory processing areas. Although metastability between resting state networks increased during task performance, cognitive ability was more closely linked to spontaneous activity. High metastability in the intrinsic connectivity of cognitive control networks was linked to novel problem solving or fluid intelligence, but was less important in tasks relying on previous experience or crystallised intelligence. Crucially, subjects with resting architectures similar or 'preconfigured' to a task-general arrangement demonstrated superior cognitive performance. Taken together, our findings support a key linkage between the spontaneous metastability of large-scale networks in the cerebral cortex and cognition.",

      "abstractNote": "Coordination in living systems—from cells to people—must be understood at multiple levels of description. Analyses and modelling of empirically observed patterns of biological coordination often focus either on ensemble-level statistics in large-scale systems with many components, or on detailed dynamics in small-scale systems with few components. The two approaches have proceeded largely independent of each other. To bridge this gap between levels and scales, we have recently conducted a human experiment of mid-scale social coordination specifically designed to reveal coordination at multiple levels (ensemble, subgroups and dyads) simultaneously. Based on this experiment, the present work shows that, surprisingly, a single system of equations captures key observations at all relevant levels. It also connects empirically validated models of large- and small-scale biological coordination—the Kuramoto and extended Haken–Kelso–Bunz (HKB) models—and the hallmark phenomena that each is known to capture. For example, it exhibits both multistability and metastability observed in small-scale empirical research (via the second-order coupling and symmetry breaking in extended HKB) and the growth of biological complexity as a function of scale (via the scalability of the Kuramoto model). Only by incorporating both of these features simultaneously can we reproduce the essential coordination behaviour observed in our experiment.",

      "abstractNote": "Much of our knowledge of coordination comes from studies of simple, dyadic systems or systems containing large numbers of components. The huge gap ‘in between’ is seldom addressed, empirically or theoretically. We introduce a new paradigm to study the coordination dynamics of such intermediate-sized ensembles with the goal of identifying key mechanisms of interaction. Rhythmic coordination was studied in ensembles of eight people, with differences in movement frequency (‘diversity’) manipulated within the ensemble. Quantitative change in diversity led to qualitative changes in coordination, a critical value separating re´ gimes of integration and segregation between groups. Metastable and multifrequency coordination between participants enabled communication across segregated groups within the ensemble, without destroying overall order. These novel findings reveal key factors underlying coordination in ensemble sizes previously considered too complicated or ’messy’ for systematic study and supply future theoretical/computational models with new empirical checkpoints.",

The present study investigated which spontaneous coordination patterns formed between 2 persons and whether a remnant of the interaction remained (“social memory”). Pairs of people sat face -to-face and continuously ﬂexed index ﬁngers while vision between partners was manipulated to allow or prevent information exchange. Trials consisted of 3 successive 20-s intervals: without vision, with vision, and again without vision. Steady, transient, or absent phase coupling was observed during vision. In support of social memory, participants tended to remain near each other’s movement frequency after the interaction ended. Furthermore, the greater the stability of interpersonal coordination, the more similar partners’ postinteractional frequencies became. Proposing that social memory resulted from prior frequency adaptation, a model based on Haken–Kelso–Bunz (HKB) oscillators reproduced the experimental ﬁndings, even for patterns observed on individual trials. Parametric manipulations revealed multiple routes to social memory through the interplay of adaptation and other model parameters. The experimental results, model, and interpretation motivate potential future research and therapeutic applications.",

These include (1) skeletal perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that get fleshed out over the course of development, mainly through play; (2) a high level of plasticity that is greatest early in life but that persists into adulthood; (3) remarkable social-learning capabilities; and (4) dispositions toward exploration and play. I next examine some evolutionary mismatches—conflicts between psychological mechanisms evolved in ancient environments and their utility in modern ones—specifically with respect to modern educational systems. I then suggest some ways educators can take advantage of children’s evolved learning abilities to minimize the effects of evolutionary mismatches, including (1) following developmentally appropriate practices (which are also evolutionarily appropriate practices), (2) increasing opportunities for physical activities, (3) increasing opportunities to learn through play, and (4) taking advantage of stress-adapted children’s “hidden talents.” I argue that evolutionary theory informs teachers and parents about how children evolved to learn and can result in moreenlightened teaching methods that will result in a more enjoyable and successful learning experiences for children.",

Nevertheless, it is useful to try to understand the relationship between different levels while all the time respecting the autonomy of each. We report a program of research that uses the theoretical concepts of coordination dynamics and quantitative measurements of simple, well-defined experimental model systems to explicitly relate neural and behavioral levels of description in human beings. Our approach is both top-down and bottomup and aims at ending up in the same place: top-down to derive behavioral patterns from neural fields, and bottom-up to generate neural field patterns from bidirectional coupling between astrocytes and neurons. Much progress can be made by recognizing that the two approaches—reductionism and emergentism—are complementary. A key to understanding is to couch the coordination of very different things—from molecules to thoughts—in the common language of coordination dynamics.",

      "abstractNote": "Understanding the coordination of multiple parts in a complex system such as the brain is a fundamental challenge. We present a theoretical model of cortical coordination dynamics that shows how brain areas may cooperate (integration) and at the same time retain their functional speciﬁcity (segregation). This model expresses a range of desirable properties that the brain is known to exhibit, including selforganization, multi-functionality, metastability and switching. Empirically, the model motivates a thorough investigation of collective phase relationships among brain oscillations in neurophysiological data. The most serious obstacle to interpreting coupled oscillations as genuine evidence of inter-areal coordination in the brain stems from volume conduction of electrical ﬁelds. Spurious coupling due to volume conduction gives rise to zero-lag (inphase) and antiphase synchronization whose magnitude and persistence obscure the subtle expression of real synchrony. Through forward modeling and the help of a novel colorimetric method, we show how true synchronization can be deciphered from continuous EEG patterns. Developing empirical efforts along the lines of continuous EEG analysis constitutes a major response to the challenge of understanding how different brain areas work together. Key predictions of cortical coordination dynamics can now be tested thereby revealing the essential modus operandi of the intact living brain.",

      "abstractNote": "Humans’ interactions with each other or with socially competent machines exhibit lawful coordination patterns at multiple levels of description. According to Coordination Dynamics, such laws specify the ﬂow of coordination states produced by functional synergies of elements (e.g., cells, body parts, brain areas, people. . .) that are temporarily organized as single, coherent units. These coordinative structures or synergies may be mathematically characterized as informationally coupled self-organizing dynamical systems (Coordination Dynamics). In this paper, we start from a simple foundation, an elemental model system for social interactions, whose behavior has been captured in the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model. We follow a tried and tested scientiﬁc method that tightly interweaves experimental neurobehavioral studies and mathematical models. We use this method to further develop a body of empirical research that advances the theory toward more generalized forms. In concordance with this interdisciplinary spirit, the present paper is written both as an overview of relevant advances and as an introduction to its mathematical underpinnings. We demonstrate HKB’s evolution in the context of social coordination along several directions, with its applicability growing to increasingly complex scenarios. In particular, we show that accommodating for symmetry breaking in intrinsic dynamics and coupling, multiscale generalization and adaptation are principal evolutions. We conclude that a general framework for social coordination dynamics is on the horizon, in which models support experiments with hypothesis generation and mechanistic insights.",

In addition to the assistance in childcare provided by grandmothers to their daughters, the experience of wise elders could have served to beneﬁt kin as well as members of the immediate group, and thus been the target of natural selection. We refer to the ﬁtness-enhancing effect of cumulative and integrative knowledge of some members of a group as the Nestor effect, after the oldest member of the group of Greek kings in the siege of Troy. Furthermore, we argue that the contributions of such Nestors resulted in cultural innovations that in turn may have promoted care and respect for the elderly. This bidirectional effect makes culture both the product and producer of longevity.",

We then discuss the concept of adaptive developmental plasticity and describe the core evolutionary concept of developmental programming and some of its applications to human development, as instantiated in life history theory and the theory of differential susceptibility to environmental inﬂuence. We then discuss the concept of adaptation from an evolutionary–developmental perspective, including ontogenetic and deferred adaptations, and examine the development of some adaptations of infancy and childhood from the domains of folk psychology and folk physics. We conclude that evolutionary theory can serve as a metatheory for developmental science.",

      "abstractNote": "Neuromechanical principles define the properties and problems that shape neural solutions for movement. Although the theoretical and experimental evidence is debated, we present arguments for consistent structures in motor patterns, i.e. motor modules, that are neuromechanical solutions for movement particular to an individual and shaped by evolutionary, developmental, and learning processes. As a consequence, motor modules may be useful in assessing sensorimotor deficits specific to an individual, and define targets for the rational development of novel rehabilitation therapies that enhance neural plasticity and sculpt motor recovery. We propose that motor module organization is disrupted and may be improved by therapy in spinal cord injury, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. Recent studies provide insights into the yet unknown underlying neural mechanisms of motor modules, motor impairment and motor learning, and may lead to better understanding of the causal nature of modularity and its underlying neural substrates.",

      "abstractNote": "Stress exposure increases risk for depressive symptoms. However, there are substantial individual differences in affective responses to stress. High-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), a marker of vagally-mediated parasympathetic activity, has been conceptualized as a psychophysiological index of emotion regulation that may moderate individuals’ responses to stress. Using a daily diary design, we tested whether individual differ­ ences in resting HF-HRV moderated the association between daily child-related stress and negative affect among a sample of 84 heterosexual couples with preschool-aged children. After controlling for participants’ age, gender, socioeconomic status, employment status, and ethnicity, hierarchical linear modeling revealed that resting HFHRV moderated both the between-person and within-person associations between self-reported child-related stress and daily negative affect. Between-person analyses indicated that the strength of the positive association between mean daily child stress and negative affect across the daily diary period increased with decreasing resting HF-HRV. Similarly, within-person analyses indicated that on days when participants reported more childrelated stress than usual, the magnitude of the increase in negative affect on that day was inversely related to resting HF-HRV. Taken together, these findings suggest that lower resting HF-HRV may index vulnerability to stress-related disturbances in negative affect. This increased negative affective response to daily stress may be one pathway through which individuals with lower resting HF-HRV are at increased risk for depressive symp­ toms over time.",

      "abstractNote": "One promising avenue toward a better understanding of the pathophysiology of positive emotional disturbances is to examine high-frequency heart rate variability (HRV-HF), which has been implicated as a potential physiological index of disturbances in positive emotional functioning. To date, only a few psychopathology relevant studies have systematically quantiﬁed HRV-HF proﬁles using more ecologically valid methods in everyday life. Using an experience-sampling approach, the present study examined both mean levels and intra-individual variability of HRV-HF – as well as comparison measures of cardiovascular arousal, sympathetic activity, and gross somatic movement – in everyday life, using ambulatory psychophysiological measurement across a six-day consecutive period among a spectrum of community adult participants with varying degrees of positive valence system disturbance, including adults with bipolar I disorder (BD; n = 21), major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 17), and healthy non-psychiatric controls (CTL; n = 28). Groups did not differ in mean HRV-HF, but greater HRVHF instability (i.e., intra-individual variation in HRV-HF) was found in the BD compared to both MDD and CTL groups. Subsequent analyses suggested that group differences in HRV-HF variability were largely accounted for by variations in clinician-rated manic symptoms. However, no association was found between HRV-HF variability and dimensional measures of positive affectivity. This work provides evidence consistent with a quadratic relationship between HRV-HF and positive emotional disturbance and represents a valuable step toward developing a more ecologically valid model of positive valence system disturbances and their underlying psychophysiological mechanisms within an RDoC framework.",

When the viewer is fully engaged, aesthetic experiences are comparable with flow experiences, which are optimal experiences described by people as “being in the zone” or “getting lost” in the moment. This study uses the framework of aesthetic experiences by Csikszentmihalyi and Robinson (1990), which conceptualizes aesthetic experiences as having 4 art-related dimensions and a fifth flow dimension. Using this conceptualization, we created the Aesthetic Experience Questionnaire (AEQ) and tested its validity in a general population of Amazon Mechanical Turk users. Results demonstrated that the AEQ consists of 4 artistically related dimensions (i.e., perceptual, emotional, cultural, understanding) and 2 flow dimensions (i.e., proximal conditions, experience). The AEQ demonstrated convergent validity with related constructs (i.e., openness to experience, inspiration, curiosity and exploration), and individuals with greater artistic experience had more intense ratings of aesthetic experiences. Overall, this study lends support to Csikszentmihalyi and Robinson’s framework of aesthetic experiences and provides a useful measure of aesthetic experiences for future studies.",

Thompson (1999) streamlined the conception of this largescale film structure by suggesting that most films are composed of four acts of generally equal length—the setup, the complicating action, the development, and the climax (often including an epilog). These acts are based on the structure of the narrative, and would not necessarily have a physical manifestation in shots and transitions. Nonetheless, exploring a sample of 150 Hollywood style films from 1935 to 2005, this article demonstrates that acts shape shot lengths and transitions. Dividing films into quarters, we found that shots are longer at quarter boundaries and generally shorter near the middle of each quarter. Moreover, aside from the beginnings and ends of films, the article shows that fades, dissolves, and other non-cut transitions are more common in the third and less common in the fourth quarters of films.",

      "abstractNote": "Fractal patterns are seemingly everywhere. They can be analyzed through Fourier and power analyses, and other methods. Cutting, DeLong, and Nothelfer (2010) analyzed as time-series data the fluctuations of shot durations in 150 popular movies released over 70 years. They found that these patterns had become increasingly fractal-like and concluded that they might be linked to those found in the results of psychological tasks involving attention. To explore this possibility further, we began by analyzing the shot patterns of almost twice as many movies released over a century. The increasing fractal-like nature of shot patterns is affirmed, as determined by both a slope measure and a long-range dependence measure, neither of which is sensitive to the vector lengths of their inputs within the ranges explored here. But the main reason for increased long-range dependence is related to, but not caused by, the increasing vector length of the shot-series samples. It appears that, in generating increasingly fractallike patterns, filmmakers have systematically explored dimensions that are important for holding our attention—shot durations, scene durations, motion, and sound amplitude—and have crafted fluctuations in them like those of our endogenous attention patterns. Other dimensions—luminance, clutter, and shot scale—are important to film style but their variations seem not to be important to holding viewers’ moment-to-moment attention and have not changed in their fractional dimension over time.",

Pearlman, the ﬁlm’s director and editor, had also written about the work that editors do to create rhythms in ﬁlm (Pearlman 2016), and, through the use of computational techniques employed previously (Cutting et al. 2018), we found that those descriptions of the editing process had parallels in the physical changes of the ﬁlm as it progressed from its ﬁrst assembled form, through a ﬁne cut, to the released ﬁlm. Basically, the rhythms of the released ﬁlm are not unlike the rhythms of heartbeats, breathing, and footfalls—they share the property of “fractality.” That is, as Pearlman shaped a story and its emotional dynamics over successive revisions, she also (without consciously intending to do so) fashioned several dimensions of the ﬁlm—shot duration, motion, luminance, chroma, and clutter—so as to make them more fractal.",

For the sound-era movies of both sets there is little evidence indicating anything other than a linear decline plotted on a logarithmic scale, with the English-language set providing stronger results. In a subsample of 24 English-language movies from 1940 to 2010 the decline in shot duration is uniform across 15 shot classes, a result that supports a broad “evolutionary” account of film change. The article also explores the proportions of these shot classes across years and genres, with the results showing that 25 percent of the decline in shot duration is due to a shift away from shot classes with longer-than-average shot durations towards those with shorter-  than-average durations, and 8 percent of the decline is due to the increased use of shot scales in which characters appear larger.",

In regular directed networks, cross-clustering coefficients can be calculated to represent different types of connected triples, such as cycles, fanning in, fanning out and middleman patterns (Fagiolo, 2007). It is also possible to create weighted (and/or directed) recurrence networks (Hasselman and Bosman, 2020), for example, by keeping the distance values of the points that fall below the recurrence threshold ε in the matrix. Another option is to use recurrence times to give more weight to triangles representing states that will recur sooner rather than later in the calculation of the cross-clustering coefficient. To summarize, the inter-system recurrence network approach to the analysis of coupled, multivariate systems produces estimates of coupling direction that are interpretable relative to the measurement context and provide insights into complex dependencies between different variables. These initial results suggest that IRN measures can at least inform posthoc evaluations of interaction dynamics, which, in the present context, could occur as soon as the Empatica4 data become available. More research is required to determine whether the method can eventually be used to inform decisions related to intervention/prevention of behavior during real-time process monitoring of physiological and/or psychological variables.</p>\n</div>",

      "abstractNote": "In the study of synchronization dynamics between interacting systems, several techniques are available to estimate coupling strength and coupling direction. Currently, there is no general ‘best’ method that will perform well in most contexts. Inter-system recurrence networks (IRN) combine auto-recurrence and cross-recurrence matrices to create a graph that represents interacting networks. The method is appealing because it is based on cross-recurrence quantification analysis, a well-developed method for studying synchronization between 2 systems, which can be expanded in the IRN framework to include N &gt; 2 interacting networks. In this study we examine whether IRN can be used to analyze coupling dynamics between physiological variables (acceleration, blood volume pressure, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature) observed in a client in residential care with severe to profound intellectual disabilities (SPID) and their professional caregiver. Based on the cross-clustering coefficients of the IRN conclusions about the coupling direction (client or caregiver drives the interaction) can be drawn, however, deciding between bi-directional coupling or no coupling remains a challenge. Constructing the full IRN, based on the multivariate time series of five coupled processes, reveals the existence of potential feedback loops. Further study is needed to be able to determine dynamics of coupling between the different layers.",

Applying modern concepts and methods of coordination dynamics we demonstrate that patterns of movement and coordination in 3-4 month-olds may be used to identify states and behavioral phenotypes of emergent agency. By means of a complete coordinative analysis of baby and mobile motion and their interaction, we show that the emergence of agency takes the form of a punctuated self-organizing process, with meaning found both in movement and stillness.",

Understanding the decisions that adolescent dancers make related to their dancing, pain, and injuries is relatively under-researched. Sociocultural contexts and the presence of social support (or not) may influence decisions and experiences of elite adolescent ballet dancers regarding their pain and injury. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine pre-professional ballet dancers’ experiences of pain and injury in relation to the culture of ballet and social support. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with pre-professional dancers (11–19 years) enrolled in a summer intensive programme at a ballet school. Using reflexive thematic analysis, five themes were developed: ignoring injuries and making risky choices, expectation of perseverance, influence of dominant constructions of the ballet body, self-assessment and selfmanagement, and the role of various individuals in injury manage­ ment and prevention. Findings from this research provide greater understanding of the way sociocultural influence and social support shapes pre-professional ballet dancers’ experiences. Strategies to better support the health and wellness of this unique dancer popu­ lation are recommended.",

      "abstractNote": "Dominant theoretical accounts of interpersonal synchrony, the temporal coordination of biobehavioral processes between several individuals, have employed a linear approach, generally considering synchrony as a positive state, and utilizing aggregate scores. However, synchrony is known to take on a dynamical form with continuous shifts in its timeline. Acting as one continuously, is not always the optimal state, due to an intrinsic tension between individualistic and synergistic forms of action that exist in many social situations. We propose an alternative theory of flexible multimodal synchrony which highlights context as a key component that defines “pulls” toward synchrony and “pulls” toward segregation inherent to the social situation. Trait-like individual differences then sensitize individuals to these contextual “pulls”. In this manner, context and individual differences provide the backdrop to the emergence of flexible and dynamical synchrony patterns, which we consider adaptive, in several modalities– behavioral, physiological, and neural. We point to two main interpersonal consequences of multimodal synchrony patterns: Social and task-oriented outcomes. We delineate hypotheses that emanate from the theory which have not been articulated by previous theories and provide two empirical proofs-of-concept: In the first, we show how individual differences modulate the effect of context on synchrony’s outcomes in a novel dyadic motor game. In the second, we re-analyze previously reported data, to show how a ‘flexibility’ data-analysis approach to synchrony improves predictive ability when testing for synchrony’s effects on social cohesion. We end this review with guidelines for future synchrony research in light of the flexible multimodal theory presented",

This research was designed to uncover commonalities between the aesthetic appreciation of viewers of films and the perceptual capacities of observers of environmental events. We assessed whether the temporal structure of events in the environment is reflected in the temporal structure of events in film. Participants in Study 1 segmented neutral environmental events to establish a benchmark temporal structure. Study 2 compared the temporal structure of editing in amateur and professionally made films. Results from these two studies suggest a particular fractal structure common to environmental event perception and the editing structure of professional films. This hypothesis was then tested in an experiment that reedited one film so as to produce four different versions, each with a different fractal structure. These versions were evaluated by audiences in terms of aesthetics (e.g., general likability, comprehension, technical aspects of craft). The results suggest that the fractal structure typical of environmental event perception is preferred, even when it is not the original, artistically intended version. It is argued that narrative films succeed, at least in part, because their temporal structure reflects the temporal structure of environmental event perception.",

      "abstractNote": "Movies have changed dramatically over the last 100 years. Several of these changes in popular English-language filmmaking practice are reflected in patterns of film style as distributed over the length of movies. In particular, arrangements of shot durations, motion, and luminance have altered and come to reflect aspects of the narrative form. Narrative form, on the other hand, appears to have been relatively unchanged over that time and is often characterized as having four more or less equal duration parts, sometimes called acts – setup, complication, development, and climax. The altered patterns in film style found here affect a movie’s pace: increasing shot durations and decreasing motion in the setup, darkening across the complication and development followed by brightening across the climax, decreasing shot durations and increasing motion during the first part of the climax followed by increasing shot durations and decreasing motion at the end of the climax. Decreasing shot durations mean more cuts; more cuts mean potentially more saccades that drive attention; more motion also captures attention; and brighter and darker images are associated with positive and negative emotions. Coupled with narrative form, all of these may serve to increase the engagement of the movie viewer.",

Identifying how people overcome the sensory differences between movies and reality provides an insight into how the same cognitive processes are used to perceive continuity in the real world.",

      "abstractNote": "This is the first comprehensive theoretical article on aesthetic emotions. Following Kant’s definition, we propose that it is the first and foremost characteristic of aesthetic emotions to make a direct contribution to aesthetic evaluation/appreciation. Each aesthetic emotion is tuned to a special type of perceived aesthetic appeal and is predictive of the subjectively felt pleasure or displeasure and the liking or disliking associated with this type of appeal. Contrary to the negativity bias of classical emotion catalogues, emotion terms used for aesthetic evaluation purposes include far more positive than negative emotions. At the same time, many overall positive aesthetic emotions encompass negative or mixed emotional ingredients. Appraisals of intrinsic pleasantness, familiarity, and novelty are preeminently important for aesthetic emotions. Appraisals of goal relevance/conduciveness and coping potential are largely irrelevant from a pragmatic perspective, but in some cases highly relevant for cognitive and affective coping. Aesthetic emotions are typically sought and savored for their own sake, with subjectively felt intensity and/or emotional arousal being rewards in their own right. The expression component of aesthetic emotions includes laughter, tears, and facial and bodily movements, along with applause or booing and words of praise or blame. Aesthetic emotions entail motivational approach and avoidance tendencies, specifically, tendencies toward prolonged, repeated, or interrupted exposure and wanting to possess aesthetically pleasing objects. They are experienced across a broad range of experiential domains and not coextensive with art-elicited emotions.",

      "abstractNote": "Popular movies have an event structure that includes scenes and sequences. Scenes are fashioned to be perceived as smoothly flowing, a feature called continuity. Discontinuity is said to occur when scene (event) boundaries are crossed. This article focuses on the structure and perception of sequences that have subscenes (i.e., scene-like components) but whose boundaries, unlike those of scenes, tend to demonstrate some perceived continuity. Although the structure of sequences has been addressed by film theory, this topic has not received psychological attention. Here, data are used from viewer judgments and physical measurements of 24 popular movies, released from 1940 to 2010. Each film was inspected for narrative shift patterns—that is, changes in location, character, or time—across shots. Sequences were determined by repeated shift types, common sound coverage, and the shorter durations of subscenes than of scenes. By these criteria, sequences have increased in movies over time. The results also show that viewer judgments of event boundaries diminish in the presence of music and of shorter and less modulated shot durations. These results fit snugly within event segmentation theory, and this categorization of movie sequences by narrative shifts can accommodate previous accounts of sequence structure.",

      "abstractNote": "Popular movies grab and hold our attention. One reason for this is that storytelling is culturally important to us, but another is that general narrative formulae have been honed over millennia and that a derived but specific filmic form has developed and has been perfected over the last century. The result is a highly effective format that allows rapid processing of complex narratives. Using a corpus analysis I explore a physical narratology of popular movies—narrational structure and how it impacts us—to promote a theory of popular movie form. I show that movies can be divided into 4 acts—setup, complication, development, and climax—with two optional subunits of prolog and epilog, and a few turning points and plot points. In 12 studies I show that normative aspects in patterns of shot durations, shot transitions, shot scale, shot motion, shot luminance, character introduction, and distributions of conversations, music, action shots, and scene transitions reduce to 5 correlated stylistic dimensions of movies and can litigate among theories of movie structure. In general, movie narratives have roughly the same structure as narratives in any other domain—plays, novels, manga, folktales, even oral histories—but with particular runtime constraints, cadences, and constructions that are unique to the medium.",

      "abstractNote": "Using a sample of 24 movies I investigate narrative shifts in location, characters, and time frame that do and do not align with viewer segmentations of events (scenes and subscenes) in popular movies. Taken independently these dimensions create eight categories, seven of change and one of nonchange. Data show that the more dimensions that are changed the more viewers agree on their segmentations, although the nonadditive variations across the seven change types are large and systematic. Dissolves aid segmentation but over the last 70 years they have been used less and less by ﬁlmmakers, except for two infrequent shift types. Locations and characters are strongly yoked, jointly accounting for most narrative shifts. There are also interactions of shift types over the 70-year span and across genres, as well as differences that affect the scale of the establishing shot in a new scene. In addition, several aspects of the narratives of individual movies affect the distributions of shift types. Together these results suggest that there are at least four different signatures of narrative shifts to be found in popular movies — general patterns across time, patterns of historical change, genre-speciﬁc patterns, and ﬁlm-speciﬁc patterns.",

The different forms that coordination takes and how it emerges and changes are of great interest to many disciplines, particularly the social and behavioral sciences, neuroscience, psychology, biology and physics itself. Inspired originally by theories of self-organization in open, nonequilibrium systems, the science of coordination (coordination dynamics) seeks to understand coordinated patterns at many scales and for multiple functions in living things. Here we review some of the key concepts of coordination dynamics along with some recent developments and posit ten tenets of the theory that may guide further understanding.",

Though unanticipated, HKB introduced, and demonstrated the power of, a new vocabulary for understanding behavior, cognition and the brain, revealed through a visually compelling mathematical picture that accommodated highly reproducible experimental facts and predicted new ones. HKB stands as a harbinger of paradigm change in several scientific fields, the effects of which are still being felt. In particular, HKB constitutes the foundation of a mechanistic science of coordination called Coordination Dynamics that extends from matter to movement to mind, and beyond.",

      "abstractNote": "A complex systems approach to psychopathology proposes that general principles lie in the dynamic patterns of psychopathology, which are not restricted to specific psychological processes like symptoms or affect. Hence, it must be possible to find general change profiles in time series data of fully personalized questionnaires. In the current study, we examined general change profiles in personalized self-ratings and related these to four measures of treatment outcome (International Symptom Rating, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21, daily symptom severity and self-reflective capacity). We analyzed data of 404 patients with mood and/or anxiety disorders who completed daily self-ratings on personalized questionnaires during psychotherapy. For each patient, a principal component analysis was applied to the multivariate time series in order to retrieve an univariate person-specific time series. Then, using classification and regression methods, we examined these time series for the presence of general change profiles. The change profile classification yielded the following distribution of patients: no-shift (n = 55; 14%), gradual-change (n = 52; 13%), oneshift (n = 233; 58%), reversed-shift (n = 39; 10%) and multiple-shifts (n = 25; 6%). The multiple-shifts group had better treatment outcome than the no-shift group on all outcome measures. The one-shift and gradual-change group had better treatment outcome than the noshift group on respectively two and three outcome measures. Overall, this study illustrates that person-specific (idiographic) and general (nomothetic) aspects of psychopathology can be integrated in a complex systems approach to psychopathology, which may combine ‘the best of both worlds’.",

We see this work as propaedeutic to future empirical work investigating the role of aesthetic selfevaluation in athletic performance.",

Yet, this line oI aesthetics research has previously suffered from insufficient external validity. We, therefore, conducted a study in which aesthetic perception was monitored in a fine art museum, unrestricting to the viewers' freedom of aesthetic choice. Visitors were invited to wear electronic gloves through which their locomotion, heart rate and skin conductance were continuously recorded. Emotional and aesthetic responses to selected works oI an exhibition were assessed using a customized questionnaire. In a sampIe oI 373 adult participants, we found that physiological responses during perception of an artwork were significantly related to aesthetic-emotional experiencing. The dimensions \"Aesthetic Quality,\" \"Surprise/Humor,\" \"Dominance,\" and \"Curatorial Quality\" were associated with cardiac measures (heart rate variability, heart rate level) and skin conductance variability. This is the first evidence that aesthetics can be statistically grounded in viewers' physiology in an ecologically valid environment-the art galleryenhancing our understanding of the effects of artworks and their curatorial staging.",

      "abstractNote": "Evidence suggests affective disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder are characterised by dysregulated autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. These findings suggest ANS dysregulation may be involved in the pathogenesis of affective disorders. Different affective states are characterised by different ANS activity patterns (i.e., an increase or decrease in sympathetic or parasympathetic activity). To understand how ANS abnormalities are involved in the development of affective disorders, it is important to understand how affective states correlate with ANS activity before their onset. Using heart rate variability (HRV) as a tool to measure ANS activity, this review aimed to look at associations between affective states and HRV in non-clinical populations (i.e., in those without medical and psychiatric disorders). Searches on PubMed and Google Scholar were completed using the following search terms: heart rate variability, autonomic nervous system, sympathetic nervous system, para­ sympathetic nervous system, affective state, mood and emotion in all possible combinations. All but one of the studies examined (N = 13), demonstrated significant associations between affect and HRV. Findings suggest negative affect, encompassing both diffused longer-term experiences (i.e., mood) as well as more focused shortterm experiences (i.e., emotions), may be associated with a reduction in parasympathetic activity as measured through HRV parameters known to quantify parasympathetic activity (e.g., high frequency (HF)-HRV). HRV measures typically linked to reduction in parasympathetic activity appear to be linked to negative affective states in non-clinical populations. However, given the complex and possibly non-linear relationship between HRV and parasympathetic activity, further studies need to clarify specificity of these findings. Future studies should investigate the potential utility of HRV measures as biomarkers for monitoring changes in affective states and for early detection of onset and relapse of depression in patients with affective disorders.",

      "abstractNote": "Emotions involve subjective experiences, behavioral performances, and physiological responses. Research concerning autonomic states corresponding to different emotions has prevailed for several decades. The present study was designed to investigate how speciﬁc emotions inﬂuence cardiac activities that reﬂect autonomic responses. Affective videos selected from a standardized Chinese database were used to induce amused, fearful, angry, and neutral emotions, while electrocardiogram and self-rated emotional experiences were recorded. Heart rate was signiﬁcantly lower in the amused condition than in the angry, fearful and neutral condition. There were no signiﬁcant differences among the latter three conditions. The root mean square of successive differences, an index of heart rate variability (HRV), was signiﬁcantly larger in the amused condition than in the fearful, neutral, and angry conditions. It was also signiﬁcantly larger in the angry condition than in the fearful condition. There were no signiﬁcant differences between the fearful and neutral, or angry and neutral conditions. These results revealed that: (1) amusement activates the parasympathetic nervous system, and (2) compared with fear, anger is more likely to be linked with parasympathetic activation. We suggest that HRV, rather than the valence dimension (i.e., positive or negative) be regarded as a potential index to discriminate emotions related to approach or avoidance motivation.",

Positions on the degree of speciﬁcity of ANS activation in emotion, however, greatly diverge, ranging from undifferentiated arousal, over acknowledgment of strong response idiosyncrasies, to highly speciﬁc predictions of autonomic response patterns for certain emotions. A review of 134 publications that report experimental investigations of emotional effects on peripheral physiological responding in healthy individuals suggests considerable ANS response speciﬁcity in emotion when considering subtypes of distinct emotions. The importance of sound terminology of investigated affective states as well as of choice of physiological measures in assessing ANS reactivity is discussed.",

The defensive response is characterized by HR increases and HF-HRV decreases. In this study, HR and HF-HRV reactivity to a visual stimulus designed to elicit an orienting response (surgery video) and a cognitive task designed to elicit a defensive response (Trier Social Stress Test, math task) were measured among 81 undergraduate students. The order of stimuli presentation was counterbalanced. The expected pattern of reactivity was observed (decreased HR and increased HF-HRV during the video condition; increased HR and decreased HF-HRV during the cognitive math task). The order of stimulus presentation significantly influenced HF-HRV reactivity. When the video stimulus was presented first, a large and significant increase in HF-HRV was observed which indicated vagal activation. When the video stimulus followed the cognitive math task stimulus, lower levels of HF-HRV reactivity and vagal activation were observed. This suggests exposure to the cognitive math task elicited a defensive response that suppressed subsequent orienting responses. Theoretical, psychophysiological, and practical implications of the observed results and future psychophysiological research directions are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Synchronized movement is a ubiquitous feature of dance and music performance. Much research into the evolutionary origins of these cultural practices has focused on why humans perform rather than watch or listen to dance and music. In this study, we show that movement synchrony among a group of performers predicts the aesthetic appreciation of live dance performances. We developed a choreography that continuously manipulated group synchronization using a defined movement vocabulary based on arm swinging, walking and running. The choreography was performed live to four audiences, as we continuously tracked the performers’ movements, and the spectators’ affective responses. We computed dynamic synchrony among performers using cross recurrence analysis of data from wrist accelerometers, and implicit measures of arousal from spectators’ heart rates. Additionally, a subset of spectators provided continuous ratings of enjoyment and perceived synchrony using tablet computers. Granger causality analyses demonstrate predictive relationships between synchrony, enjoyment ratings and spectator arousal, if audiences form a collectively consistent positive or negative aesthetic evaluation. Controlling for the influence of overall movement acceleration and visual change, we show that dance communicates group coordination via coupled movement dynamics among a group of performers. Our findings are in line with an evolutionary function of dance–and perhaps all performing arts–in transmitting social signals between groups of people. Human movement is the common denominator of dance, music and theatre. Acknowledging the time-sensitive and immediate nature of the performer-spectator relationship, our study makes a significant step towards an aesthetics of joint actions in the performing arts.",

The merging was achieved online with high spatial and temporal resolution, using data gloves and a wireless network. This data set was used to generate information cartographies of visitors, visualizing their spatial behavior and physiological responses in the environment. In a field study with 576 museum visitors, the methodology was successfully implemented. Significant associations between physiology and aesthetic evaluations supported the validity of the cartographic representations; participants reported little reactivity toward the technical equipment. This methodology appears feasible for environmental behavior research in general.",

Seventy-three young adults underwent a laboratory stressor, and physiological and affective reactivity and recovery were examined. Openness was positively associated with reports of greater stress exposure during childhood, but was unrelated to the number of stressors in the past year. Higher Openness was associated with less blood pressure reactivity, increases in respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and a modest increase in positive affect during the laboratory stressor. Life stress was associated with poor sleep quality for low-, but not high-, Open individuals. These ﬁndings suggest greater stress resilience among high-Open persons and greater vulnerability to adverse effects of stress among low-Open individuals.",

The overlapping set of associations, along with theoretical models positing connections between the brain regions subserving the executive functions and the parasympathetic nervous system, suggest that the two factors should be correlated. Seeking to address limitations in prior research, the current study examined the association between EF, measured comprehensively with individually-administered neuropsychological tests and controlling for lower-order cognitive processes, and resting physiology, measured with impedence cardiography, in healthy, community participants (68% female; mean age = 27, SD = 6.5). Results confirmed a significant association between EF and resting HF-HRV, but no association with resting state sympathetic nervous system activation (pre-ejection period). These findings may inform future investigation of transdiagnostic mechanisms related to these two individual difference factors.",

      "abstractNote": "It is widely acknowledged that people are emotionally affected by movies, but how does the physical structure of movies contribute to emotional engagement? To answer this question, we measured subjective and objective emotional tension as forty viewers watched a series of short movies. We mapped the resulting data against the dynamic low-level structure of each movie, isolating the effects of clutter, luminance, motion, shot density, shot scale, and sound amplitude on emotional response. Across all measures, viewers’ responses to the movies were notably synchronized, and this synchrony appears to be partly driven by low-level cinematic structure. These findings provide empirical support for several long-standing ideas that lie at the intersection of film theory and the psychology of emotion.",

      "abstractNote": "Traditional models of skill learning posit that skilled action unfolds in an automatic manner and that control will prove deleterious to movement and performance proficiency. These perspectives assume that automated processes are characterised by low levels of control and vice versa. By contrast, a number of authors have recently put forward hybrid theories of skilled action which have sought to capture the close integration between fine-grained automatic motor routines and intentional states. Drawing heavily on the work of Bebko et al. (2005) and Christensen et al. (2016), we argue that controlled and automated processes must operate in parallel if skilled performers are to address the wide range of challenges that they are faced with in training and competition. More specifically, we show how skilled performers use controlled processes to update and improve motor execution in training contexts and to stabilise performance under pressurised conditions.",

      "abstractNote": "Using fractal analyses to study events allows us to capture the scale-independence of those events, that is, no matter at which level we study a phenomenon, we should get roughly the same results because events exhibit similar structure across scales. This is demonstrably true in mathematical fractals but is less assured in behavioral fractals. The current research directly tests the scale-independence hypothesis in the behavioral domain by exploring the fractal structure of aggression, a social phenomenon comprising events that span temporal scales from minutes of face-to-face arguments to centuries of international armed conflicts. Using publicly available data, we examined the temporal fractal structure of four scales of aggression: wars (very macrolevel, worldwide data), riots (macrolevel, worldwide data), violent crimes (microlevel, data gathered from cities and towns in the United States of America), and body movement during arguments (very microlevel, data gathered on American participants). Our results lend mixed support to the scale-independence hypothesis and provide insight into the self-organization of human interactions.",

      "abstractNote": "As we identify with characters on screen, we simulate their emotions and thoughts. This is accompanied by physiological changes such as galvanic skin response (GSR), an indicator for emotional arousal, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), referring to vagal activity. We investigated whether the presence of a cinema audience affects these psychophysiological processes. The study was conducted in a real cinema in Berlin. Participants came twice to watch previously rated emotional film scenes eliciting amusement, anger, tenderness or fear. Once they watched the scenes alone, once in a group. We tested whether the vagal modulation in response to the mere presence of others influences explicit (reported) and implicit markers (RSA, heart rate (HR) and GSR) of emotional processes in function of solitary or collective enjoyment of movie scenes. On the physiological level, we found a mediating effect of vagal flexibility to the mere presence of others. Individuals showing a high baseline difference (alone vs. social) prior to the presentation of film, maintained higher RSA in the alone compared to the social condition. The opposite pattern emerged for low baseline difference individuals. Emotional arousal as reflected in GSR was significantly more pronounced during scenes eliciting anger independent of the social condition. On the behavioural level, we found evidence for emotion-specific effects on reported empathy, emotional intensity and Theory of Mind. Furthermore, people who decrease their RSA in response to others’ company are those who felt themselves more empathically engaged with the characters. Our data speaks in favour of a specific role of vagal regulation in response to the mere presence of others in terms of explicit empathic engagement with characters during shared filmic experience.",

The paper has two objectives: ﬁrst, to provide an explicit statement of the theory; and second, to introduce the features of a polyvagal perspective. The polyvagal perspective emphasizes how an understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms and phylogenetic shifts in neural regulation leads to different questions, paradigms, explanations, and conclusions regarding autonomic function in biobehavioral processes than peripheral models. Foremost, the polyvagal perspective emphasizes the importance of phylogenetic changes in the neural structures regulating the autonomic nervous system and how these phylogenetic shifts provide insights into the adaptive function and the neural regulation of the two vagal systems.",

      "abstractNote": "Contemporary strategies for health and wellbeing fail our biological needs by not acknowledging that feelings of safety emerge from internal physiological states regulated by the autonomic nervous system. The study of feelings of safety has been an elusive construct that has historically been dependent upon subjectivity. Acknowledging that feelings of safety have a measurable underlying neurophysiological substrate would shift investigations of feelings of safety from a subjective to an objective science. Polyvagal Theory provides an innovative scientiﬁc perspective to study feelings of safety that incorporates an understanding of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. This perspective identiﬁes neural circuits that downregulate neural regulation of threat reactions and functionally neutralize defensive strategies via neural circuits communicating cues of safety that enable feelings of safety to support interpersonal accessibility and homeostatic functions. Basically, when humans feel safe, their nervous systems support the homeostatic functions of health, growth, and restoration, while they simultaneously become accessible to others without feeling or expressing threat and vulnerability. Feelings of safety reﬂect a core fundamental process that has enabled humans to survive through the opportunistic features of trusting social engagements that have coregulatory capacities to mitigate metabolically costly defense reactions. Through the study of neural development and phylogeny, we can extract foundational principles and their underlying mechanisms through which the autonomic nervous system leads to feelings of safety and opportunities to co-regulate. Several principles highlight the validity of a science of safety that when implemented in societal institutions, ranging from healthcare to education, would enhance health, sociality, and lead to greater productivity, creativity, and a sense of wellbeing. By respecting our need to feel safe as a biological imperative linked to survival, we respect our phylogenetic heritage and elevate sociality as a neuromodulator that functionally provides the scientiﬁc validation for a societal focus on promoting opportunities to experience feelings of safety and co-regulation.",

      "abstractNote": "The current study provides the ﬁrst published evidence that the parasympathetic component of the autonomic nervous system diﬀerentiates the response proﬁles between individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and controls. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a non-invasive marker of the inﬂuence of the myelinated vagal ﬁbers on the heart, and heart period were collected during the presentation of ﬁlm clips of varying emotional content. The BPD and control groups had similar initial levels of RSA and heart period. However, during the experiment the groups exhibited contrasting trajectories, with the BPD group decreasing RSA and heart period and the control group increasing RSA and heart period. By the end of the experiment, the groups diﬀer signiﬁcantly on both RSA and heart period. The correlation between the changes in RSA and heart period was signiﬁcant only for the control group, suggesting that vagal mechanisms mediated the heart period responses only in the control group. The ﬁndings were consistent with the Polyvagal Theory [Porges, S. W. (1995). Orienting in a defensive world: Mammalian modiﬁcations of our evolutionary heritage: A Polyvagal Theory. Psychophysiology, 32, 301–318; Porges, S. W. (2001). The Polyvagal Theory: Phylogenetic substrates of a social nervous system. International Journal of Psychophysiology, 42, 123–146; Porges, S. W. (2003). Social engagement and attachment: A phylogenetic perspective. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1008, 31–47.], illustrating diﬀerent adaptive shifts in autonomic state throughout the course of the experiment. The BPD group ended in a physiological state that supports the mobilization behaviors of ﬁght and ﬂight, while the control group ended in a physiological state that supports social engagement behaviors. These ﬁnding are consistent with other published studies demonstrating atypical vagal regulation of the heart with other psychiatric disorders.",

However, the clinical interpretation of HRV features remain widely debated or unknown. Standardisation within studies of HRV in psychiatric disorders is poor, making it difficult to reproduce or build on previous work. Recently, a Guidelines for Reporting Articles on Psychiatry and Heart rate variability checklist has been proposed to address this issue. Here we assess studies of HRV in bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder against this checklist and discuss the implication for ongoing research in this area.",

Medically unexplained symptoms are related to personality features and can be assessed by autonomic measurement. The patterns are hypothesised to identify gender differences. We recruited 30 male and 30 female healthy volunteers. All participants completed the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) and heart-rate variability (HRV) measurement. Correlation analysis was performed to identify the relationships between TPQ scores and HRV parameters. For the subjects as a whole, the subdimension harm avoidance 4 (HA4, fatigability and asthenia) was found to be negatively correlated with low-frequency (LF) power, high-frequency (HF) power and total power (TP) of HRV. Novelty seeking 1 (NS1, exploratory excitability) was found to be positively correlated with LF power and TP. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the interactions exploratory excitability x gender and fatigability x gender are predictors of LF and HF power, respectively. Our result supports the hypothesis that personality features such as exploratory excitability and fatigability are associated with autonomic functioning and that gender is a moderator in these relationships.",

      "abstractNote": "The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between personality and resting heart rate variability (HRV) indices. Healthy volunteers (n = 106) completed a 240-item Big Five personality inventory, the state/ Trait Anxiety inventory, and a ten minute electrocardiographic recording. Time and frequency domain estimates of HRV were derived from the cardiac time series and related to the Big Five dimensions of personality, to personality types extracted from a cluster analysis, and to Trait Anxiety. Frequency domain measures of HRV (HRV-HF, LF/HF) were associated with speciﬁc dimensions of personality, but signiﬁcance was not noted for the time domain measure (STD-RR). Furthermore, distressed personality types exhibited signiﬁcantly greater autonomic imbalance (LF/HF) than other personality types. However, signiﬁcance was not noted for the time domain measure (STD-RR). These results can be explained with reference to a contemporary model of neurovisceral integration. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Eligible studies included those of any study design, experimental or observational, as long as motor creativity was measured. Three databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus and ScienceDirect) were searched from the earliest possible start dates to December 2021. No risk of bias assessment was performed as the study outcomes were not the focus of the review. After screening for eligibility, 22 articles were included for review, all having measured motor creativity. Of the 22 articles, 16 measured generic motor creativity, while the remaining 6 measured task-specific motor creativity. Further, 16 of the studies tested motor creativity with largely static environmental constraints, while the remaining 6 were conducted with dynamic environmental constraints. Using a contemporary understanding of motor creativity, most motor creativity tests presently do not possess sufficient task specificity and environmental dynamism, which may not provide an appropriate context for the emergence of creative motor action.",

      "abstractNote": "Several competing aetiologies of developmental dyslexia suggest that the problems with acquiring literacy skills are causally entailed by low-level auditory and/or speech perception processes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diverging claims about the specific deficient peceptual processes under conditions of strong inference. Theoretically relevant acoustic features were extracted from a set of artificial speech stimuli that lie on a /bAk/-/dAk/ continuum. The features were tested on their ability to enable a simple classifier (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis) to reproduce the observed classification performance of average and dyslexic readers in a speech perception experiment. The ‘classical’ features examined were based on component process accounts of developmental dyslexia such as the supposed deficit in Envelope Rise Time detection and the deficit in the detection of rapid changes in the distribution of energy in the frequency spectrum (formant transitions). Studies examining these temporal processing deficit hypotheses do not employ measures that quantify the temporal dynamics of stimuli. It is shown that measures based on quantification of the dynamics of complex, interaction-dominant systems (Recurrence Quantification Analysis and the multifractal spectrum) enable QDA to classify the stimuli almost identically as observed in dyslexic and average reading participants. It seems unlikely that participants used any of the features that are traditionally associated with accounts of (impaired) speech perception. The nature of the variables quantifying the temporal dynamics of the speech stimuli imply that the classification of speech stimuli cannot be regarded as a linear aggregate of component processes that each parse the acoustic signal independent of one another, as is assumed by the ‘classical’ aetiologies of developmental dyslexia. It is suggested that the results imply that the differences in speech perception performance between average and dyslexic readers represent a scaled continuum rather than being caused by a specific deficient component.",

      "abstractNote": "Gestures during speaking are typically understood in a representational framework: they represent absent or distal states of affairs by means of pointing, resemblance, or symbolic replacement. However, humans also gesture along with the rhythm of speaking, which is amenable to a non-representational perspective. Such a perspective centers on the phenomenon of vocal-entangled gestures and builds on evidence showing that when an upper limb with a certain mass decelerates/accelerates sufficiently, it yields impulses on the body that cascade in various ways into the respiratory–vocal system. It entails a physical entanglement between body motions, respiration, and vocal activities. It is shown that vocal-entangled gestures are realized in infant vocal–motor babbling before any representational use of gesture develops. Similarly, an overview is given of vocal-entangled processes in non-human animals. They can frequently be found in rats, bats, birds, and a range of other species that developed even earlier in the phylogenetic tree. Thus, the origins of human gesture lie in biomechanics, emerging early in ontogeny and running deep in phylogeny.",

      "abstractNote": "Background: Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic nervous system activity, has been studied in a number of psychiatric disorders during the resting state but evidence on its circadian patterns in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is scarce. We sought to identify and differentiate HRV circadian patterns in MDD, BPD and healthy controls (HC) while exploring potential physio­ logical mechanisms associated with mood and emotion dysregulation.\nMethods: 24-Hour electrocardiographic recordings were obtained from fifty subjects (16 HC, 18 BPD, 16 MDD). HRV was calculated during sleep and wake periods. Associations with mood and affect measures, and with cognitive emotion regulation strategies and self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation (DERS) were exam­ ined. Participant’s resilience traits were explored in relation to mood and emotion regulation variables.\nResults: Lower diurnal measures of HRV (i.e, RMSSD and HF) were observed in MDD subjects compared to HCs. Decreased HF was observed during wake vs. sleep in MDD patients. HAM-D and negative affect scores negatively correlated with HRV in MDD and BPD respectively. MDD and BPD exhibited a positive relationship between the implementation of emotion regulation strategies and HRV compared to HC. Increased resilience was associated with lower HAM-D and DERS scores in BPD and HC.\nConclusion: HRV alterations characterized by low diurnal cardiac parasympathetic control constitute a potential trait biomarker of major depression and psychiatric vulnerability to depressive episodes in BPD. HRV anomalies in MDD may persist during clinical remission. Diurnal HRV may represent a psychophysiological index of mood and emotion regulation.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the inﬂuence of trait EI in athletes when they have to face the stress of competition. Thirty male handball players (MAge = 22.5 years; SD = 1.7) were exposed to a competition-like stressor in the laboratory consisting of 20 min of negative imagery coupled with the sound of a crowd hissing. Their trait EI was measured with the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire, and a mental stress indicator, the low-frequency/highfrequency (LF/HF) ratio, was calculated from their heart rate variability. A repeated measures analysis of variance showed a signiﬁcant Time of Measurement Â Trait EI interaction, F(1, 28) = 6.036, p = .020, g2p ¼ :18, indicating that high trait EI athletes experienced a lower increase of stress compared to their low trait EI counterparts. Through its inﬂuence on the LF/HF ratio, trait EI may help athletes cope better with stress.",

      "abstractNote": "Background. Emotion dysregulation is a core feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD), which often co-occurs with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Difficulties in emotion regulation (ER) have been linked to lower high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), a measure of autonomous nervous system functioning. However, previous research on vagallymediated heart rate in BPD revealed heterogeneous findings and the effects of comorbid PTSD and dissociation on HF-HRV are not yet completely understood. This study aim to investigate HF-HRV during resting-state and an ER task in female BPD patients with comorbid PTSD (BPD + PTSD), patients without this comorbidity (BPD), and healthy controls (HC).\nMethods. 57 BPD patients (BPD: n = 37, BPD + PTSD: n = 20) and 27 HC performed an ER task with neutral, positive, and negative images. Participants were instructed to either attend these pictures or to down-regulate their upcoming emotions using cognitive reappraisal. Subjective arousal and wellbeing, self-reported dissociation, and electrocardiogram data were assessed.\nResults. Independent of ER instruction and picture valence, both patient groups (BPD and BPD + PTSD) reported higher subjective arousal and lower wellbeing; patients with BPD + PTSD further exhibited significantly lower HF-HRV compared with the other groups. Higher self-reported state dissociation predicted higher HF-HRV during down-regulating v. attending negative pictures in BPD + PTSD.\nConclusions. Findings suggest increased emotional reactivity to negative, positive, and neutral pictures, but do not provide evidence for deficits in instructed ER in BPD. Reduced HF-HRV appears to be particularly linked to comorbid PTSD, while dissociation may underlie attempts to increase ER and HF-HRV in BPD patients with this comorbidity.",

This follows directly from preceding experimental literature and is further motivated by accounts and experiences of practicing cinematographers (authors included), which indicates a correspondence between the two. We designed three different cinematic scenes with indifferent moods, and shot each one time with Steadicam, dolly, handheld, and static camera, resulting in 12 different clips. A total of 44 non-professional participants watched the clips and rated their reactions in terms of arousal and degree of involvement. Experimental results are mixed: movement affects the sense of involvement but not necessarily emotional response. We present and discuss some further explorative results and possible future directions to improve the design. We argue in this contribution that there is value in experimental approaches to cinematography, enabling the systematic study of creative intuitions and audience responses in controlled settings.",

It synthesizes research from evolutionary psychology and cognitive ﬁlm studies, as well as moral psychology. It explains how the ﬁlm experience is embodied: experienced not only cognitively but with the whole body and its interaction with the world. Also discussed is how the biological underpinning of genres are based on three major types of emotions: a group of reptilian emotions central to action and adventure; a group of mammalian emotions related to offspring of care; and separation panic/ grief. A special human development to enhance group living has expanded emotions of care to also underpin emotions linked to group living such as loyalty to tribe, aggression towards out-groups and submission to tribal hierarchy, central in war, sci-ﬁ and fantasy ﬁlms, and also emotions related to social rituals such as comedy, tragedy and musical. A discussion is also offered of how the historical development from hunter-gatherers via societies based on agriculture to the present post-agrarian society has moulded moral emotions; this is exempliﬁed in relation to crime ﬁlms. Finally, also considered is how age and gender inﬂuence genre preferences.",

The Neurovisceral Integration Model has provided a structural framework for understanding brainbody integration, highlighting the role of the vagus in adaptation to the environment. In the present paper, we emphasise a temporal framework in which HRV may be considered a missing, structural link between psychological moments and mortality, a proposal we label as Neurovisceral Integration Across a Continuum of Time (or NIACT). This new framework places neurovisceral integration on a dimension of time, highlighting implications for lifespan development and healthy aging, and helping to bridge the gap between clearly demarcated disciplines such as psychology and epidemiology. The NIACT provides a novel framework, which conceptualizes how everyday psychological moments both aﬀect and are aﬀected by the vagus in ways that have long-term eﬀects on mortality risk. We further emphasize that a longitudinal approach to understanding change in vagal function over time may yield novel scientiﬁc insights and important public health outcomes.",

      "abstractNote": "Profound aesthetic experiences associated with awe—often described as a sense of wonder, amazement, fascination, or being moved and touched—have received less attention than milder states like pleasure, liking, and interest. Who tends to experience these powerful states? We suggest that openness to experience, although not normally seen as an emotional trait, is a propensity for awe-like experiences that stretch one’s normal ways of thinking about oneself and the world. A sample of 103 adults took part in a two-phase study that examined the role of openness to experience in two domains: nature and music. In the first phase, people viewed 14 images of the sky and space and rated their experience of each on items related to awe, wonder, and fascination. In the second phase, people listened to a song with qualities known to evoke awe (“Hoppípolla” by Sigur Rós) and rated their experience of it afterward. Openness to experience predicted the experience of awe for both space images (r = .48) and music (r = .35), and the experience of awe was correlated across the domains (r = .35). The other four factors of personality had much smaller effects, and extraversion’s effects were consistently near zero, indicating that awe-like experience differs from the activated positive affectivity typical of extraversion. Overall, the results support the view of openness to experience as an essentially aesthetic trait and extend it to deeper aesthetic states.",

In total, 3,254 participants completed an online survey assessing individual difference and preference ratings for different paintings. Participants were also asked to rate each observed painting for emotional liking and perceived complexity, which enabled examination of whether personality could predict artistic preferences when the latter was classified on the basis of consensual, rather than researcher-led or art historical, taxonomies. Correlations and structural equation models showed that the correlates and predictors of artistic preferences were stronger when art was classified using consensual ratings (particularly in the case of complex art) than according to researcher-led or art historical taxonomies. Although these findings are somewhat exploratory and more comprehensive measures of individual differences and art preferences could be employed, they suggest that trait-congruent classifications of aesthetic stimuli may improve prediction and understanding of individual differences in artistic preferences.",

This article details the development of a 120-item version of the IPIP-NEO from an Internet sample (N = 21,588) and the subsequent testing of its psychometric properties in Goldberg’s (2008) Eugene-Springﬁeld community sample (N = 481), two additional large Internet samples (Ns = 307,313 and 619,150) and a local sample (N = 160).

      "abstractNote": "Movies and film make up a large component of our cultural landscape, but what those films say about our personalities is relatively under-studied. With this research, I set out to discover any connections between our film and movie preferences and our personalities, using the Big Five Factor model of personality as a guideline. Another important factor in my analysis was the interaction of gender. Participants were asked to indicate the degree to which they enjoyed various film genres, and then were given a brief Big Five Factor personality test. Notable correlations were found between the personality factor of extraversion and the genres of comedy and romance, and between the factor of openness to experience and the genres of documentary and science fiction. Significant gender differences were also observed, with women rating the genres of drama and romance higher than men, and men rating action and science fiction higher than women. These differences likely explain some of the correlations between traits and film preference in this study, as the sample was predominantly female. The findings of this study help lay the groundwork for a comprehensive, media-based model of personality, but further research is needed to develop the model to its full extent.",

We brieﬂy review theoretical foundations and present experimental data related to aesthetic chills. These results suggest that aesthetic chills are inhibited by exposing the subject to an incoherent prime prior to the chill-eliciting stimulation and that a meaningful prime makes the aesthetic experience more pleasurable than a neutral or an incoherent one. Aesthetic chills induced by narrative structures seem to be related to the pinnacle of the story, to have a signiﬁcant calming effect and subjects describe a strong empathy for the characters. We discuss the relation between meaning-making and aesthetic emotions at the psychological, physiological, narratological, and mathematical levels and propose a series of hypotheses to be tested in future research.",

We obtained cardiovascular and electrodermal signals from participants while they viewed emotional movies. We found that the ANS signals were temporally aligned across individuals, indicating a reliable stimulus-driven response. The degree of response reliability was associated with the emotional time line of the movie. Finally, individual differences in ANS response reliability were strongly correlated with the subjective emotional responses. The current research offers a methodological approach for studying physiological responses during dynamic emotional situations.",

Few studies, however, have examined cardiac changes during the viewing of high arousal pleasant ﬁlms. To clarify this issue, the present study assessed evaluative, facial and autonomic reactions in both men and women during the viewing of highly arousing pleasant, as well as unpleasant, ﬁlms. Results indicated a similar skin conductance increase and heart rate deceleration which were greater than those observed during the viewing of a neutral ﬁlm. Compared to men, women rated both ﬁlms as less pleasant and rated the unpleasant ﬁlm as more arousing. The present ﬁndings suggest that sustained exposure to pleasant and unpleasant stimuli elicit similar cardiac orienting when stimuli are equated for subjective report of emotional arousal.",

In a between-subjects design, three audience groups watched either the full version (audio–video) of a suspenseful short movie (\n              Love Field\n              ) or a video-only version or listened to the audio track only. Audience responses were assessed with a combination of continuous response measurement (CRM) and psychophysiological measures, comprising heart rate (i.e., inter-beat interval, IBI), pulse volume amplitude (PVA), and skin conductance level (SCL). Frame-by-frame content coding was performed to identify distinct plot segments and musical moods (tense vs. relaxing) and mark the critical visual and auditory events that directed the audience’s inferences about the nature of the plot and elicited specific outcome expectations. Results showed that continuous self-report data and objective physiological measures were largely dissociated, suggesting different processing modalities. Tense music alone induced feelings of suspense (CRM) even in the absence of any clues about the story content. Overall, the audio-only version led to the highest arousal levels, as indicated by SCL and PVA, while the video-only version led to the lowest arousal levels. IBI data revealed short-term heart rate deceleration responses to salient narrative clues that could be interpreted in terms of heightened attention and cognitive resource allocation. Results are discussed in light of a multidimensional framework of tension and suspense and a terminological differentiation of both concepts.",

The degree to which this physiological synchrony occurs is related to attentional engagement. Factors that can inﬂuence attention, such as instructions, salience of the narrative stimulus and characteristics of the individual, affect physiological synchrony. The demonstrability of synchrony depends on the amount of data used in the analysis. We investigated how demonstrability of physiological synchrony varies with varying group size and stimulus duration. Thirty participants watched six 10 min movie clips while their HR and EDA were monitored using wearable sensors (Movisens EdaMove 4 and Wahoo Tickr, respectively). We calculated inter-subject correlations as a measure of synchrony. Group size and stimulus duration were varied by using data from subsets of the participants and movie clips in the analysis. We found that for HR, higher synchrony correlated signiﬁcantly with the number of answers correct for questions about the movie, conﬁrming that physiological synchrony is associated with attention. For both HR and EDA, with increasing amounts of data used, the percentage of participants with signiﬁcant synchrony increased. Importantly, we found that it did not matter how the amount of data was increased. Increasing the group size or increasing the stimulus duration led to the same results. Initial comparisons with results from other studies suggest that our results do not only apply to our speciﬁc set of stimuli and participants. All in all, the current work can act as a guideline for future research, indicating the amount of data minimally needed for robust analysis of synchrony based on inter-subject correlations.",

We propose that an answer to this question must take into account the feeling of being moved, a complex emotional state that plays a major role in the history of poetics and aesthetics and has recently begun to attract interest in psychological research. We conducted a study in an actual cinema using film clips as sadness-eliciting stimuli. In total, 76 participants watched 38 clips that presented variations of the same sad scenario: a character or a group of characters learns about the death of a close person. The study revealed a highly significant positive correlation between sadness and enjoyment. However, this correlation was almost fully mediated by the feeling of being moved. Hence sadness primarily functions as a contributor to and intensifier of the emotional state of being moved. Furthermore, the study revealed that being moved is a positive term in two senses. First, it refers to an overall positive feeling. Second, it indicates a positive value judgment regarding the power of a film to elicit such feelings. Therefore, we conclude that it is the overall positive feeling of being moved itself that recipients of sad films and other forms of art enjoy—we simply like to be moved. Taken together, our findings are significant for investigations of the so-called ‘sad-film paradox’ and the aesthetic pleasure associated with negative emotions more generally.",

Content valence (positive or negative) and the emotional context in which videos were delivered (presentation order) had significant impact on the probability of exhibiting a chaotic attractor. Using the nonlinear dynamic systems approach, this study provides novel understandings of emotional information processing, the electrodermal system, and the relationship between physiological and emotional experiences.",

      "abstractNote": "Art therapy encourages the use of art materials to express feelings and thoughts in a supportive environment. Art materials differ in ﬂuidity and are postulated to thus differentially enhance emotional response (the more ﬂuid the material the more emotion elicited). Yet, to the best of our knowledge, this assumption has not been empirically tested. The current study aimed to examine the emotional and physiological responses to art-making with different art materials. We were particularly interested in vagal activity, indexed by heart rate variability (HRV), because of its association with numerous health related outcomes. In this study, 50 adults (mean age 33 ± 10.27 years, 52% males) participated in a repeated measures experiment, in which they were requested to draw with three art materials (order randomized) differing in their level of ﬂuidity (pencil, oil-pastels, and gouache paint) intermittent with periods of music. We measured the emotional response to art-making with each material using a self-report measure and matrices of HRV using a wearable electrocardiogram device. We calculated two indices of HRV, one indicative of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity, and one indicative of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. Art-making with gouache paint and oil-pastels resulted in improved positive mood, while pencil did not. Art-making explained approximately 35% of the variability in parasympathetic reactivity, which may indicate changes in emotional regulation processes during the art-making task. Yet, ﬂuidity was not sufﬁcient to explain the reaction to art-making. Surprisingly, the largest suppression of PNS and augmentation of the SNS occurred during art-making with oil-pastels and not with Gouache. Moreover, PNS and SNS reactivity to oil-pastels were related to emotional valance, which may point to emotional engagement. We can conclude that art-making with oil-pastels, ﬁrst created in Japan in 1924 to increase self-expression of students, results in a unique emotional and physiological responses. These ﬁndings might be explained by the enhanced tactile experience of art-making with oil-pastels along with their relative ﬂuidity, triggering an arousal pattern. Further studies that take the format and presentation of the materials as well as the content of the artwork, into account, are needed.",

This will be supplemented by my own experience in the Fall of 2022 where I will be a Director of Photography for four individual films of varying genres as well as by a film I wrote and directed with a focus on the horror/thriller genre that will serve as a kind of case study for my research. I plan to include stills of my work and excerpts from the script, supplemented by a commentary on the shot composition of those particular scenes, as my creative thesis.",

While a theatrical release is still the primary release form, more and more films are watched via online streaming in home cinemas. Watching films at home is unquestionably high in convenience, but an understudied question is, how this shift in context—from the movie theater to the home cinema—affects the cinematic experience while watching a feature film. To test this, aesthetic emotions and the overall judgment of the cinematic experience were compared between watching a film in a movie theater or home cinema. In line with cognitive models of art appreciation, it was found that a movie theater context leads to a stronger emotional experience and a more favorable judgment. Only boredom was felt stronger in the home cinema. This movie theater effect persisted during a second viewing, regardless of context. These results have theoretical and practical implications for empirical aesthetics, movie fans, and the movie industry.",

We explored how interest and confusion in response to film were predicted by people’s cognitive appraisals and level of expertise. People who varied in expertise viewed 10 film clips taken from submissions to a local film festival. For each film, people gave ratings of interest, confusion, and their relevant appraisals. Expertise was measured with a preliminary Aesthetic Fluency in Film scale. Multilevel models showed that appraising a film clip as complex and comprehensible predicted interest, a finding that replicates past interest research. Additionally, appraising a film clip as complex and incomprehensible predicted confusion. Experts in film found the films more interesting and less confusing overall, and their interest was more strongly predicted by complexity.",

The literature on the topic, however, both theoretically and empirically speaking, is rather diffuse and contradictory. In this review, we give an overview of the main theories and empirical findings relating order, complexity, and their interplay to aesthetic appreciation, focusing on research concerning the visual modality. Additionally, we propose our own view on the interplay between order and complexity, in line with the reviewed theories and findings. Besides general relations, also individual differences in order, complexity, aesthetic appreciation, and their interrelations are discussed. With this review, we hope to conceptually clarify the literature and point to new roads for investigation in the field of human aesthetics.",

The aim is to build a framework that is able to capture the contextsensitive and dynamic nature of such experiences. The notion of ‘flux of art experience’ is introduced to emphasise that it is an emergent phenomenon which remains in a continuous state of change. After a critical analysis of the predominant model architecture, based on the concept of a causal chain of components, we introduce interaction-dominant modelling as an alternative. This type of model is based on the theory of complex dynamical systems. Subsequently, two important concepts of the general theory are discussed, viz. synergetics and metastability, and how they apply to art experiences. In the last part of the essay guidelines for the empirical study of art experiences befitting the introduced modelling approach are presented, together with some example studies.",

      "abstractNote": "The last decade has witnessed a renaissance of empirical and psychological approaches to art study, especially regarding cognitive models of art processing experience. This new emphasis on modeling has often become the basis for our theoretical understanding of human interaction with art. Models also often deﬁne areas of focus and hypotheses for new empirical research, and are increasingly important for connecting psychological theory to discussions of the brain. However, models are often made by different researchers, with quite different emphases or visual styles. Inputs and psychological outcomes may be differently considered, or can be under-reported with regards to key functional components. Thus, we may lose the major theoretical improvements and ability for comparison that can be had with models. To begin addressing this, this paper presents a theoretical assessment, comparison, and new articulation of a selection of key contemporary cognitive or information-processing-based approaches detailing the mechanisms underlying the viewing of art. We review six major models in contemporary psychological aesthetics. We in turn present redesigns of these models using a uniﬁed visual form, in some cases making additions or creating new models where none had previously existed. We also frame these approaches in respect to their targeted outputs (e.g., emotion, appraisal, physiological reaction) and their strengths within a more general framework of early, intermediate, and later processing stages. This is used as a basis for general comparison and discussion of implications and future directions for modeling, and for theoretically understanding our engagement with visual art.",

      "abstractNote": "With the advent of modernity, change and novelty have become the core values of artistic production. At the same time the derogatory term “kitsch” was coined to contrast truly ground-breaking artistic achievements. In this article, we argue that kitsch and avant-garde art ideally represent two complementary types of aesthetic experience: a ﬂuent one that allows for immediate emotional gratiﬁcation (kitsch) and a disﬂuent one that requires cognitive elaboration (art). We make a case that preferences for the one or the other are dynamically related to a set of conﬂicting needs which constitute the basic dilemma of human attachment behavior: needs for safety and intimacy versus needs for arousal and autonomy. Based on the Zurich Model of Social Motivation we hypothesize that social distance regulation and aesthetic liking are synchronized via notions of selfefﬁcacy and autonomy: Whenever we feel safe and self-sufﬁcient, an appetence for arousal (curiosity) is likely to arise that increases our interest in unfamiliar conspeciﬁcs as well as in innovative, cognitively challenging aesthetic stimuli (art). By contrast, when we feel vulnerable and dependent, a longing for safety and relatedness (nostalgia) attracts us not only to familiar and trustworthy individuals but also to conventional aesthetic stimuli charged with positive emotions (kitsch). This theoretical framework offers an integrative perspective on dynamics of aesthetic liking in that it unites a wide variety of phenomena from anthropology, developmental, and cognitive psychology with concepts and ﬁndings from art history, sociology of art, and empirical aesthetics.",

Also, in both experiments we explored the relation between postural control, emotional states of being moved and aesthetic appraisal. Results revealed differences in postural control in Experiment 1, most notably more dynamically complex postural sway for Pollocks, which did not generalize to the broader range of paintings in Experiment 2. More variable, dynamically stable, complex and intermittent postural sway was found, however, comparing subsets of high-motion and low-motion paintings and between subclasses of abstract painting styles. Emotional states of being moved and aesthetic appraisal were associated with postural control, both across paintings and across people in several ways. Together these findings provide preliminary empirical evidence for a radical embodied art experience.",

      "abstractNote": "The phenomenon of creativity has received a growing amount of attention from scholars working across a range of disciplines. While this research has produced many important insights, it has also traditionally tended to explore creativity in terms of the reception of products or outcomes, conceiving of it as a cognitive process that is limited to the individual domain of the creative agent. More recently, however, researchers have begun to develop perspectives on creativity that highlight the patterns of adaptive embodied interaction that occur between multiple agents, as well as the broader sociomaterial milieu they are situated in. This has promoted new understandings of creativity, which is now often considered as a distributed phenomenon. Because music involves such a wide range of socio-cultural, bodily, technological, and temporal dimensions it is increasingly taken as a paradigmatic example for researchers who wish to explore creativity from this more relational perspective. In this article, we aim to contribute to this project by discussing musical creativity in light of recent developments in embodied cognitive science. More specifically, we will attempt to frame an approach to musical creativity based in an 4E (embodied, embedded, enactive, and extended) understanding of cognition. We suggest that this approach may help us better understand creativity in terms of how interacting individuals and social groups bring forth worlds of meaning through shared, embodied processes of dynamic interactivity. We also explore how dynamical systems theory (DST) may offer useful tools for research and theory that align closely with the 4E perspective. To conclude, we summarize our discussion and suggest possibilities for future research.",

      "abstractNote": "Research in perception and appreciation is often focused on snapshots, stills of experience. Static approaches allow for multidimensional assessment, but are unable to catch the crucial dynamics of affective and perceptual processes; for instance, aesthetic phenomena such as the “Aesthetic-Aha” (the increase in liking after the sudden detection of Gestalt), effects of expectation, or Berlyne’s idea that “disorientation” with a “promise of success” elicits interest. We conducted empirical studies on indeterminate artistic movies depicting the evolution and metamorphosis of Gestalt and investigated (i) the effects of sudden perceptual insights on liking; that is, “Aesthetic Aha”-effects, (ii) the dynamics of interest before moments of insight, and (iii) the dynamics of complexity before and after moments of insight. Via the so-called Continuous Evaluation Procedure (CEP) enabling analogous evaluation in a continuous way, participants assessed the material on two aesthetic dimensions blockwise either in a gallery or a laboratory. The material’s inherent dynamics were described via assessments of liking, interest, determinacy, and surprise along with a computational analysis on the variable complexity. We identiﬁed moments of insight as peaks in determinacy and surprise. Statistically signiﬁcant changes in liking and interest demonstrated that: (i) insights increase liking, (ii) interest already increases 1500 ms before such moments of insight, supporting the idea that it is evoked by an expectation of understanding, and (iii) insights occur during increasing complexity. We propose a preliminary model of dynamics in liking and interest with regard to complexity and perceptual insight and discuss descriptions of participants’ experiences of insight. Our results point to the importance of systematic analyses of dynamics in art perception and appreciation.",

      "abstractNote": "Aesthetic emotions are elicited by different sensory impressions generated by music, visual arts, literature, theater, ﬁlm, or nature scenes. Recently, the AESTHEMOS scale has been developed to facilitate the empirical assessment of such emotions. In this article we report a semantic proﬁle analysis of aesthetic emotion terms that had been used for the development of this scale, using the GRID approach. This method consists of obtaining ratings of emotion terms on a set of meaning facets (features) which represent ﬁve components of the emotion process (appraisal, bodily reactions, action tendencies, expression, and feelings). The aims here were (a) to determine the dimensionality of the GRID features when applied to aesthetic emotions and compare it to published results for emotion terms in general, and (b) to examine the internal organization of the domain of aesthetic emotion terms in order to identify salient clusters of these items based on the similarity of their feature proﬁles on the GRID. Exploratory Principal Component Analyses suggest a four-dimensional structure of the semantic space consisting of valence, power, arousal, and novelty, converging with earlier GRID studies on large sets of standard emotion terms. Using cluster analyses, 15 clusters of aesthetic emotion terms with similar GRID feature proﬁles were identiﬁed, revealing the internal organization of the aesthetic emotion terms domain and meaningful subgroups of aesthetic emotions. While replication for further languages is required, these ﬁndings provide a solid basis for further research and methodological development in the realm of aesthetic emotions.",

Drawing on the reflective model of aesthetic experience (Cupchik, 1995) and the concept of appreciation (Oliver & Bartsch, 2010), we propose a multi-level view of affective processing that includes simple affect schemata as well as more elaborate forms of sociomoral reasoning that build on this basic layer of emotional meaning. To better understand how affective factors can stimulate or impede cognitive elaboration processes, we review research on motivated cognition that has dealt with the influence of arousal, valence, and personal relevance on cognitive depth. The role of affect in defensive information processing (i.e., the motivated neglect or denial of information) is also considered. Specifically, we discuss how research on motivated cognition can help explain thought-provoking entertainment experiences, and the potential of such experiences to stimulate self-reflection and personal growth.",

      "abstractNote": "Aesthetic perception and judgement are not merely cognitive processes, but also involve feelings. Therefore, the empirical study of these experiences requires conceptualization and measurement of aesthetic emotions. Despite the long-standing interest in such emotions, we still lack an assessment tool to capture the broad range of emotions that occur in response to the perceived aesthetic appeal of stimuli. Elicitors of aesthetic emotions are not limited to the arts in the strict sense, but extend to design, built environments, and nature. In this article, we describe the development of a questionnaire that is applicable across many of these domains: the Aesthetic Emotions Scale (AESTHEMOS). Drawing on theoretical accounts of aesthetic emotions and an extensive review of extant measures of aesthetic emotions within specific domains such as music, literature, film, painting, advertisements, design, and architecture, we propose a framework for studying aesthetic emotions. The AESTHEMOS, which is based on this framework, contains 21 subscales with two items each, that are designed to assess the emotional signature of responses to stimuli’s perceived aesthetic appeal in a highly differentiated manner. These scales cover prototypical aesthetic emotions (e.g., the feeling of beauty, being moved, fascination, and awe), epistemic emotions (e.g., interest and insight), and emotions indicative of amusement (humor and joy). In addition, the AESTHEMOS subscales capture both the activating (energy and vitality) and the calming (relaxation) effects of aesthetic experiences, as well as negative emotions that may contribute to aesthetic displeasure (e.g., the feeling of ugliness, boredom, and confusion).",

Performative aspects of aesthetic texts may be measured by such dynamic events as temporal gestalts, patterning, procedural schemata, judgment heuristics, working memory (which includes the stream of consciousness, adverbial sensing, and a ﬂowing sense of selfhood), projections, radial associations, reidentiﬁcations (frequency, vibration), and the everpresent possibilia of paradigms and the nearly true. Processes engender immediacy and directionality – a ﬂow toward continual becoming. The result is a new perspective on the nature of textuality – its ﬂuid properties, its collective behavior – without necessarily displacing substantialist accounts that rely on long-term memory and the immobile signposts of sign, cue, form, and thingness.",

      "abstractNote": "When reading a story or watching a film, comprehenders construct a series of representations in order to understand the events depicted. Discourse comprehension theories and a recent theory of perceptual event segmentation both suggest that comprehenders monitor situational features such as characters’ goals in order to update these representations at natural boundaries in activity. However, the converging predictions of these theories had not previously been tested directly. Two studies provided evidence that changes in situational features such as characters, their locations, interactions with objects, and goals are related to the segmentation of events in both narrative texts and films. A third study indicated that clauses with event boundaries are read more slowly than other clauses, and that changes in situational features partially mediate this relationship. A final study suggested that the predictability of incoming information influences reading rate and possibly event segmentation. Taken together, these results suggest that processing situational changes during comprehension is an important determinant of how one segments ongoing activity into events, and that this segmentation is related to the control of processing during reading.",

      "abstractNote": "Understanding the interrelations among students’ cognitive, emotional, motivational, and volitional processes is an emergening focus in educational psychology. A dynamical, component systems theory of emotions is presented as a promising framework to further unravel these complex interrelations. This framework considers emotions to be a process that is composed of cognitive, neurophysiological, motor expression, and motivational processes—as well as feelings—that mutually regulate each other over time and within a particular context. This comprehensive view of emotions provides a more complete understanding of the social and dynamical nature of emotions and the integration of emotions within learning processes. Using a dynamical, component systems view of emotional processes, interrelated with learning processes, involves a shift in research methodologies and instruments to adequately investigate the role(s) of emotions within learning contexts. But more importantly, it may provide a powerful framework that can clearly show teachers and parents the role(s) that emotions play in students’ acquisition of knowledge and skills.",

However, flexibility has not been consistently or adequately defined, leading to obstacles in the interpretation of past research and progress toward enhanced theory. We present a model of socioemotional flexibility—and its counterpart rigidity—at three time scales using dynamic systems modeling. At the real-time scale (micro), moment-to-moment fluctuations in affect are identified as dynamic flexibility. At the next higher mesotime scale, adaptive adjustments to changes in context are characterized as reactive flexibility. At the macro scale is flexibility that occurs across months or years, reflecting flexibility due to developmental or life transitions. Implications of the model and suggestions for future research are discussed.",

Higher flexibility is associated with better psychosocial adjustment. In line with the Flex3 model, flexibility during interactions between 96 mothers and their adolescent daughters (Mage = 13.99 years) at two different time scales were examined in the current study: (1) within positive and negative emotional contexts (dynamic flexibility) and (2) between positive and negative emotional contexts (reactive flexibility). Mothers and daughters completed the Emotional Rollercoaster task—a series of five 3-minute discussions on times they felt the following strong emotions towards each other: (1) Happy/Excited, (2) Worried/Sad, (3) Proud, (4) Frustrated/Annoyed, and (5) Grateful. In general, higher dynamic (within-discussion) flexibility and moderate levels of flexibility across discussions were associated with lower internalizing symptoms and higher relationship quality. Results support the Flex3 model and also suggest that in addition to emotional valence (positive versus negative), specific emotion contexts (e.g., sad versus frustrated) differentially influence socioemotional flexibility in mother-daughter dyads.",

Speciﬁcally, the review examines the following three research questions: (1) How are dyadic affective ﬂexibility and emotional inertia operationalized, and are they related to youth psychopathology? (2) How are dyadic affective ﬂexibility and emotional inertia related, and does this relation occur at micro- and mesotimescales? and (3) How do these constructs combine to predict clinical outcomes? Using the Flex3 model of socioemotional ﬂexibility as a frame, the current study proposes that dyadic affective ﬂexibility and emotional inertia are bidirectionally related at micro- and mesotimescales, which yields psychopathological symptoms for youth. Speciﬁc future directions for examining individual, dyadic, and cultural characteristics that may inﬂuence relations between these constructs and psychopathology are also discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "A rich and complex temporal structure of variability in postural sway characterizes healthy and adaptable postural control. However, neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, which often manifest as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia, disrupt this healthy variability. This study examined postural sway in young and older adults, including individuals with Parkinson’s disease, under different upright standing conditions to investigate the potential connection between the temporal structure of variability in postural sway and Parkinsonism. A novel and innovative method called oriented fractal scaling component analysis was employed. This method involves decomposing the two-dimensional center of pressure (CoP) planar trajectories to pinpoint the directions associated with minimal and maximal temporal correlations in postural sway. As a result, it facilitates a comprehensive assessment of the directional characteristics within the temporal structure of sway variability. The results demonstrated that healthy adults control posture along two orthogonal directions closely aligned with the traditional anatomical anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) directions. In contrast, older adults and individuals with Parkinson’s disease controlled posture along suborthogonal directions that significantly deviate from the AP and ML directions. Moreover, changes in the temporal structure of variability in postural sway predict changes in its directional characteristics. These findings suggest that the altered temporal structure of sway variability is evident in individuals with Parkinson’s disease and underlies postural deficits, surpassing what can be explained solely by the natural aging process. Importantly, this method of assessing the directional characteristics of the temporal structure of sway variability can produce potential biomarkers for the early detection of Parkinson’s disease that can aid the diagnostic process, facilitating timely interventions and monitoring of disease progression.",

      "abstractNote": "Group growth is of fundamental importance to understanding social influence. How do passive bystanders become psychologically involved when observing a small group of actors? Our hypothesis was that the kind of solidarity displayed by the group shapes the bonds that emerge with an audience. We studied audience responses to modern dance performances conducted two field experiments and one lab experiment (N = 263, 363 and 147). Performances were developed jointly with choreographers: dancers acted as an aggregate of individuals or displayed mechanical or organic solidarity. As predicted, the emergent bond between audience members and dancers was influenced by the kind of solidarity on display. When dancers displayed mechanical solidarity, the emergence of bonds was mainly predicted by perceived unity. When organic solidarity was displayed, the individual value of each dancer played a key role. Interestingly, overall artistic evaluation was affected in parallel with the development of bonds: the kind of solidarity displayed influenced performance evaluation. Finally, Experiment 2b showed that solidarity displayed on stage influenced the postperformance cooperative behaviour among audience members. The paper discusses the social psychological pathways by which performing arts influence communities and society.",

      "abstractNote": "This chapter questions the causal-constitution fallacy raised against the extended mind. It does so by presenting our signature temporal thesis about how to understand constitutive relations in the context of the extended mind, and with respect to dynamical systems, more broadly. We call this thesis diachronic constitution. We will argue that temporalising the constitution relation is not as remarkable (nor problematic) as it might initially seem. It is (arguably) inevitable, given local interactions between microscale and macroscale states of (coupled) dynamical systems. We focus primarily on the metaphysics of the extended mind in this paper. However, we also show how our account of diachronic constitution has important implications for the metaphysics of dependence relations more generally as well as an emerging literature on inter-level explanations in the mechanistic framework applied to the discussion over extended, enactive and embodied cognition.",

      "abstractNote": "Discussions of the function of early nervous systems usually focus on a causal flow from sensors to effectors, by which an animal coordinates its actions with exogenous changes in its environment. We propose, instead, that much early sensing was\n              reafferent\n              ; it was responsive to the consequences of the animal's own actions. We distinguish two general categories of reafference—translocational and deformational—and use these to survey the distribution of several often-neglected forms of sensing, including gravity sensing, flow sensing and proprioception. We discuss sensing of these kinds in sponges, ctenophores, placozoans, cnidarians and bilaterians. Reafference is ubiquitous, as ongoing action, especially whole-body motility, will almost inevitably influence the senses. Corollary discharge—a pathway or circuit by which an animal tracks its own actions and their reafferent consequences—is not a necessary feature of reafferent sensing but a later-evolving mechanism. We also argue for the importance of reafferent sensing to the evolution of the\n              body-self\n              , a form of organization that enables an animal to sense and act as a single unit.\n            \n            This article is part of the theme issue ‘Basal cognition: multicellularity, neurons and the cognitive lens’.",

Hence, naturalistic reading and writing performance is nonstationary and exhibits fluctuations and transitions. However, instead of being just complications for the analysis of such data, they are also informative about cognitive change, fluency, and reading or writing skill. To use and quantify such dynamics, one needs appropriate statistics that capture these aspects. In this article I introduce Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) as a tool to capture such dynamic structure. After a conceptual introduction of the analysis, I present a stepby-step tutorial on how to run RQA using R. Guidance is given with regard to common issues and best practices using this time-series analysis technique. Finally, I review previous results from studies applying RQA to reading and writing and summarize current hypotheses and interpretations of RQA measures in the context of reading and writing.",

In How Things Shape the Mind (2013) I offered a detail exposition of the major working hypotheses and the vision of mind that it embodies. Here, introducing this special issue, more than just presenting a broad overview of MET, I seek to enrich and extend that vision and discuss its application to the study of mind and matter. I begin by laying out the philosophical roots, theoretical context and intellectual kinship of MET. Then I offer a basic outline of this theoretical framework focusing on the notions of thinging and metaplasticity. In the last part I am using the example of pottery making to illustrate how MET can be used to inform empirical research and how it might complement new research in phenomenology and embodied cognitive science.",

      "abstractNote": "An emerging perspective on human cognition and performance sees it as a kind of self-organizing phenomenon involving dynamic coordination across the body, brain and environment. Measuring this coordination faces a major challenge. Time series obtained from such cognitive, behavioral, and physiological coordination are often complicated in terms of non-stationarity and non-linearity, and in terms of continuous vs. categorical scales. Researchers have proposed several analytical tools and frameworks. One method designed to overcome these complexities is recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis, developed in the study of non-linear dynamics. It has been applied in various domains, including linguistic (categorical) data or motion (continuous) data. However, most previous studies have applied recurrence methods individually to categorical or continuous data. To understand how complex coordination works, an integration of these types of behavior is needed. We aimed to integrate these methods to investigate the relationship between language (categorical) and motion (continuous) directly. To do so, we added temporal information (a time stamp) to categorical data (i.e., language), and applied joint recurrence analysis methods to visualize and quantify speech-motion coordination coupling during a rap performance. We illustrate how new dynamic methods may capture this coordination in a small case-study design on this expert rap performance. We describe a case study suggesting this kind of dynamic analysis holds promise, and end by discussing the theoretical implications of studying complex performances of this kind as a dynamic, coordinated phenomenon.",

Either or both of these assumptions can be rejected. Behaviorism rejects the instrumental but not the one-way aspect of the traditional view, thus leaving itself open to charges of veriﬁcationism. Ecological views reject the one-way aspect but not the instrumental aspect of the traditional view, so that perception and action are seen as instrumentally interdependent. It is argued here that a better alternative is to reject both assumptions, resulting in a two-level interdependence view in which perception and action co-depend on dynamically circular subpersonal relations and as a result may be more than merely instrumentally interdependent. This is illustrated by reference to motor theories of perception and control theories of action.",

The fact that the hypothesis continues to spark debate and to generate both new insights and new objections suggests that it continues to play a productive role in contemporary philosophy of mind.",

      "abstractNote": "Modern psychology has, to all intents and purposes, become synonymous with cognitive psychology, with an emphasis on the idea that the brain is a form of computer, whose job is to take in sensory input, process information, and produce motor output. This places the brain at a remove from both the body and environment and denies the intimate connection that exists between them. As a result, a great injustice is done to both human and nonhuman animals: On the one hand, we fail to recognize the distinctive nature of nonhuman cognition, and on the other hand, we continue to promote a somewhat misleading view of human psychological capacities. Here, I suggest a more mutualistic, embodied, enactive view might allow us to ask more interesting questions about how animals of all kinds come to know their worlds, in ways that avoid the (inevitable) anthropocentric baggage of the cognitivist viewpoint.",

We studied the Chilean Chamber of Deputies’ by analyzing the agreement ratio and the voting outcome of each vote over the last 19 years with a Recurrence Quantification Analysis and an entropy analysis (Sample Entropy). Two significant changes in the temporal variability were found: one in 2014, where the voting outcome became more recurrent and with less entropy, and another in 2018, where the agreement ratio became less recurrent and with higher entropy. These changes may be directly related to major changes in the Chilean electoral system and the composition of the Chamber of Deputies, given that these changes occurred just after the first parliamentary elections with non-compulsory voting (2013 elections) and the first elections with a proportional system in conjunction with an increase in the number of deputies (2017 elections) were held.",

      "abstractNote": "The analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) aids in the diagnosis of various diseases related to the malfunction of the autonomic nervous system. Traditional approaches for analysis of HRV require the signal to be reasonably stationary during the period of observation. This is not possible when analyzing long duration signals. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is robust to this issue, as it removes external interferences (\"trends\") and considers only intrinsic characteristics which are present throughout the signal. DFA is typically performed by segmenting the signal into shorter windows. This has two undesirable effects: (i) if the signal length is not a multiple of the window length, then at least one window will have fewer samples than the others; and (ii) discontinuities are observed on the detrended signal at the edges of each window. Both issues may be addressed using a sliding window. We propose and evaluate this idea, comparing its results with those obtained using the traditional approach. Experiments using different kinds of random and real HRV signals are presented. Statistically significant differences were observed with the proposed approach, especially with respect to .2 values. The proposed method also presented a great reduction in .1 error for white noise, which is a good model for congestive heart failure, with respect to .1 correlations.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper, multi-fractal characteristics of speech signals are analyzed based on MF-DFA, and it is found that the multi-fractal features are influenced greatly by frame length and noise, besides, there is a little difference between them among speech frames. Secondly, motivated by framing and using frame shift to ensure the continuity and smooth transition of speech in speech signals processing, an advanced MF-DFA (MF-DFA with forward moving overlapping windows) is proposed. The length of moving overlapping windows is determined by parameter θ . Given the value of time scale s, we have MF-DFA with the maximum moving overlapping windows and MF-DFA with half overlapping windows when θ = 1/s and θ = 1/2 respectively. Moreover, when θ = 1 we exactly have MF-DFA. Numerical experiments and analysis illustrate that the multi-fractal characteristics based on AMF-DFA outperform MF-DFA and MF-DMA in stability, noise immunity and discrimination.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper, I argue that enactivism and computationalism—two seemingly incompatible research traditions in modern cognitive science—can be fruitfully reconciled under the framework of the free energy principle (FEP). FEP holds that cognitive systems encode generative models of their niches and cognition can be understood in terms of minimizing the free energy of these models. There are two philosophical interpretations of this picture. A computationalist will argue that as FEP claims that Bayesian inference underpins both perception and action, it entails a concept of cognition as a computational process. An enactivist, on the other hand, will point out that FEP explains cognitive systems as constantly self-organizing to non-equilibrium steady-state. My claim is that these two interpretations are both true at the same time and that they enlighten each other.",

An orientation to this improvisational dance as an embodied practice and experience is given. Enactivism is proposed as an adequate framework for further study. It is argued that approaching tango in terms of participatory sense-making, mutual incorporation and consensually coordinated action helps in clarifying its possible contributions to (cultural) psychology. Possible contributions such as facilitating the study of the dynamics of interaction, of intersubjectivity and of culture as joint activity.",

      "abstractNote": "Nonverbal behavior is a central factor influencing the therapeutic relationship. Despite broad agreement on its importance, empirical studies assessing nonverbal behavior in counseling and psychotherapy are relatively scarce and often limited to few cases. One restraining factor may be the resources needed when assessing nonverbal behavior. Movement dynamics are an exemplary aspect of nonverbal behavior that can be captured with computer vision – a discipline concerned with the automated analysis of footage captured on video. One of the simplest methods requiring no special detectors, devices, or markers on patients or therapists is based on the assessment of differences in sequences of pictures (frames) found in video-recordings. Algorithms of so-called frame-differencing methods may be implemented on commonly available computers, and they provide a good, straightforward assessment of e.g. patient's and therapist's movement dynamics in counseling- and therapy sessions. Frame-differencing methods in psychology date back 36 years, but their use in counseling- and psychotherapy research is only recently gaining momentum. In this introductory article, the use of one specific application suitable for the assessment of human motion from archival video material is presented. Motion energy analysis (MEA) is a procedure particularly appropriate for clinicians and researchers who have access to recordings of sessions or who wish to record their own video material. Focusing on the phenomenon of nonverbal synchrony – the coordination of movement between patient and therapist, we provide a step-by-step demonstration of the stages involved in a successful application of MEA in psychotherapy research.",

We invited 105 adults (aged 18-33, 70% women) to talk for 15-minutes about three self-referencing topics (introduction, bodily perception/sensory life, socio-emotional life). A video frame-by-frame differentiation method provided time-series to perform Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), extracting four measures (Determinism/Entropy/Laminarity/MeanLine). Multilevel models linked Big-Five traits (IPIP-NEO-120) to embodied dynamics. Neuroticism predicted lower determinism and fluctuating dynamics when talking about bodily perception/sensory life and socioemotional life; less complexity and stability when talking about socioemotional life, and posttask negative affect. Extraversion predicted regular/deterministic dynamics when talking about bodily perception/sensory life. Conscientiousness predicted less deterministic and more variability. Agreeableness predicted low post-task negative affect. The results are discussed integrating enactive/complexity, and personality perspectives.",

Studies show adverse consequences of CM on emotional functioning and regulation. This article focuses on differential imprint of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse and/or neglect exteriences during childhood on emotional functionin later in life To study this, we calculated how intense, variable, unstable, inert, and diverse the daily emotions were of 290 Dutch adults (aged 19-73, measured thrice daily during 30 days (90 measurements per person, for five emotion dynamic indices). Participants described abuse/neglect retrospectively using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). In our structural equation model (SEM), only physical abuse was unrelated to all five emotion dynamic indices. Abuse and neglect showed specific patterns, e.g., emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and physical neglect associated mostly with negative emotions, and emotional neglect predominantly with positive emotion dynamics. CM types were associated differentialy with low versus high arousal emotion dynamics (i.e sexual abuse associated with increased and emotional neglect with reduced emotion dynamics). Dissecting CM effects on adult emotion dynamics may inform theories on the ontogenesis and functioning of emotions, theories on abuse and neglect and the prevention of their developmental sequalia, and help to identify and understand well-adjusted and (dys-)functional emotional development.",

      "abstractNote": "Motion Energy Analysis (MEA) is a procedure that allows to automatically assess the amount of persons’ movement from video recordings. Recent studies used MEA to investigate nonverbal synchrony, i.e. the occurrence of simultaneous movement, suggesting the existence of an association with relationship quality. In patient-therapist dyads, synchrony predicted therapeutic alliance, empathy, as well as treatment outcome. The article presents rMEA, an open-source R package that allows to import, filter, and visualize dyadic time-series of nonverbal behavior generated by other MEA software. The package includes a fast, state-of-the-art, moving window cross-correlation algorithm with lag analysis, which provides a user-friendly interface for the assessment of nonverbal synchrony. Through the analysis of a motivating example (40 psychotherapy intake interviews split between dropouts and good cases) the article provides an in-depth description of the package main functions and a tutorial for a typical analysis in this field, requiring only the most basic knowledge of the R language and environment. The rich visualization capabilities of the software provide powerful tools for the various steps involved in the diagnostics, analysis, interpretation and publication of these data. Overall, the paper aims to empower psychotherapy researchers and other interaction scientists to investigate nonverbal synchrony in their own dyads.",

These methods have enjoyed increasing popularity in the cognitive and social sciences since a recognition that many behavioral and neurophysiological processes are intrinsically time dependent and reliant on environmental and social context has emerged. Recurrence-based methods are particularly suited for time-series that are non-stationary or have complicated dynamics, such as longer recordings of continuous physiological or movement data, but are also useful in the case of time-series of symbolic data, as in the case of text/verbal transcriptions or categorically coded behaviors. In the past, they have been used to assess changes in the dynamics of, or coupling between physiological and behavioral measures, for example in joint action research to determine the co-evolution of the behavior between individuals in dyads or groups, or for assessing the strength of coupling/correlation between two or more time-series. In this paper, we provide readers with a conceptual introduction, followed by a step-by-step explanation on how the analyses are performed in R with a summary of the current best practices of their application.",

Here, we present a generalized variance method for multivariate detrended fluctuation analysis (mvDFA). The advantage of this extension is that it can be applied to multivariate time series and considers intercorrelation between these time series when estimating fractal properties. First, we briefly describe how fractal fluctuations have advanced a dynamic system understanding of cognition. Then, we describe mvDFA in detail and highlight some of the advantages of the approach for simulated data. Furthermore, we show how mvDFA can be used to investigate empirical multivariate data using electroencephalographic recordings during a time‐estimation task. We discuss this methodological development within the framework of interaction‐dominant dynamics. Moreover, we outline how the availability of multivariate analyses can inform theoretical developments in the area of dynamic systems in human behavior.\n          , \n            Human behavior exhibits complex dynamics and is multidimensional. To investigate human behavior from a dynamic systems perspective, multivariate methods are needed that extract relevant parameters that can be used to link such human data to properties of dynamic systems. Here, we present an extension of multivariate fractal analysis to further such research.",

      "abstractNote": "Fractal properties in time series of human behavior and physiology are quite ubiquitous, and several methods to capture such properties have been proposed in the past decades. Fractal properties are marked by similarities in statistical characteristics over time and space, and it has been suggested that such properties can be well-captured through recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis. However, no methods to capture fractal ﬂuctuations by means of recurrence-based methods have been developed yet. The present paper takes this suggestion as a point of departure to propose and test several approaches to quantifying fractal ﬂuctuations in synthetic and empirical time-series data using recurrence-based analysis. We show that such measures can be extracted based on recurrence plots, and contrast the different approaches in terms of their accuracy and range of applicability.",

This is then discussed from the perspective of three philosophical stances, namely essentialism, social constructionism, and pragmatism. Historical examples—such as drapetomania, homosexuality, and schizophrenia—illustrate how culture, in particular thoughts about race, sexuality, and civil rights, can shape views on what is mentally normal and what not. Anticipating the later chapter on substance use, addiction receives special attention. Practical ways to assess dependence and also its definition in the\n              DSM\n              are introduced. Finally, the epidemiology of mental disorders is discussed. The question of whether the prevalence of these disorders is increasing is of special relevance. The chapter’s interim conclusion is that mental disorders should be better understood as dynamic biopsychosocial processes which can continually change; they are thus not concrete things (e.g., brain disorders).",

      "abstractNote": "Pain is an unfortunate consequence of many medical procedures, which in some patients becomes chronic and debilitating. Among the factors affecting medical pain, clinician-patient (C-P) similarity and nonverbal communication are particularly important for pain diagnosis and treatment. Participants (N = 66) were randomly assigned to clinician and patient roles and were grouped into C-P dyads. Clinicians administered painful stimuli to patients as an analogue of a painful medical procedure. We manipulated the perceived C-P similarity of each dyad using groups ostensibly based on shared beliefs and values, and each patient was tested twice: Once with a same group clinician (concordant, CC) and once with a clinician from the other group (discordant, DC). Movement synchrony was calculated as a marker of nonverbal communication. We tested whether movement synchrony mediated the effects of group concordance on patients’ pain and trust in the clinician. Movement synchrony was higher in CC than DC dyads. Higher movement synchrony predicted reduced pain and increased trust in the clinician. Movement synchrony also formally mediated the group concordance effects on pain and trust. These ﬁndings increase our understanding of the role of nonverbal C-P communication on pain and related outcomes. Interpersonal synchrony may be associated with better pain outcomes, independent of the speciﬁc treatment provided.",

      "abstractNote": "Background: One of the main diagnostic features of individuals with autism spectrum disorders is nonverbal behaviour difficulties during naturalistic social interactions. The ‘Interactional Heterogeneity Hypothesis’ of ASD proposes that the degree to which individuals share a common ground substantially influences their ability to achieve smooth social interactions.\nMethods: To test this hypothesis, we filmed 29 autistic and 29 matched typically developed adults engaged in several conversational tasks. Windowed cross-lagged correlations were computed using the time series of motion energy of both individuals in a dyad. These coefficients were then compared across the three dyad types that were homo- or heterogenous with respect to diagnosis: pairs of two autistic individuals, two typically developed individuals or pairs of one autistic and one typically developed person.\nResults: We found that all dyad types achieved above-chance interpersonal synchrony, but that synchrony was more expressed in typical dyads compared to both autistic and mixed dyads. Limitations: The method presented here provides only one, albeit objective and robust, approach to explore synchrony. The methodological choices as well as the lack of consideration for other communication modalities may limit our interpretation of the findings. Moreover, the sample size is small with respect to exploring associations between synchrony and various outcome and social skill measures.\nConclusions: The present results do not provide support for the Interactional Heterogeneity Hypothesis given that autistic individuals do not coordinate better when interacting with another autistic individual, compared to when interacting with a typical individual.",

The analyses are based on the analysis of essays from a subsample with the average age 54.6 years (SD = 9.0), who completed questionnaires for cancer-related distress (IES) and depression symptoms (BDI-SF). The results show a signiﬁcant association between an increase in recurrent patterns of text structure from ﬁrst to last writing session and a decrease in cancer-related distress at 3 months post-intervention. Furthermore, the change in structure from ﬁrst to last essay displayed a moderate, but signiﬁcant correlation with change in cancer-related distress from baseline to 9 months post-intervention. The results suggest that changes in recurrence patterns of text structure might be an indicator of cognitive restructuring that leads to amelioration of cancer-speciﬁc distress.",

      "abstractNote": "This study examined ways in which rhythmic features of movement contribute to bonding between individuals. Though previous studies have described synchrony as a form of social glue, this research extends those findings to consider the impact of fast versus slow tempo on movement synchrony. This two-part experiment examined dyadic interactions as they occurred between same-sex strangers (Study 1) and friends (Study 2). Participants were video-recorded as they engaged in 5- or 6-min chats, and synchrony was evaluated using wavelet transform via calculations of cross-wavelet coherence. Study 1 employed regression commonality analysis and hierarchical linear modeling and found that among various frequency bands, rapport between individuals was positively associated with synchrony under 0.025 Hz (i.e., slower than once every 40 s) and 0.5–1.5 Hz (i.e., once every 0.67–2 s). On the contrary, Study 2 determined that synchrony of 0.5–1.5 Hz was not impactful among friend dyads and only predictive of the motivation to cultivate a friendly relationship during interactions with strangers. These results indicate the existence of a distinctive rhythm for bonding individuals, and the role of pre-existing friendship as a moderator of the bonding effect of synchrony. However, the role of relative phase (i.e., timing of movement; same versus opposite timing) remains unclear, as the ratio of in- and anti-phase patterning had no significant influence on perceived rapport and motivation to develop relationships. On the basis of the research results, a theoretical contribution is proposed to the study of interpersonal coordination.",

      "abstractNote": "Movement synchrony describes the coordination of body movements. In psychotherapy, higher movement synchrony between therapist and patient has been associated with higher levels of empathy, therapeutic alliance, better therapy outcome, and fewer drop-outs. The current study investigated movement synchrony during the psychotherapeutic treatment of female adolescents with borderline personality disorder. It was hypothesized that there are higher levels of movement synchrony in the analyzed therapy sessions compared to pseudo-interactions. Further, we tested whether higher levels of movement synchrony correlate with stronger patients’ symptom reduction and whether higher movement synchrony predicts higher postsession ratings. A total of 356 sessions from 16 completed psychotherapies of adolescent patients with BPD were analyzed. Movement synchrony was assessed with motion energy analysis and an index of synchrony was calculated by lagged cross-correlation analysis. As hypothesized, the ﬁndings support higher levels of movement synchrony in therapy sessions compared to pseudo-interactions (Cohen’s d = 0.85). Additionally, a correlation of movement synchrony with better therapy outcome was found (standardized beta = −0.43 indicating stronger personality functioning impairment reduction). The post-session ratings were negatively associated with higher levels of movement synchrony (standardized beta = −0.1). The relevance of movement synchrony and potential implications for clinical practice are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Synchrony between interacting systems is an important area of nonlinear dynamics in physical systems. Recently psychological researchers from multiple areas of psychology have become interested in nonverbal synchrony (i.e., coordinated motion between two individuals engaged in dyadic information exchange such as communication or dance) as a predictor and outcome of psychological processes. An important step in studying nonverbal synchrony is systematically and validly diﬀerentiating synchronous systems from non-synchronous systems. However, many current methods of testing and quantifying nonverbal synchrony will show some level of observed synchrony even when research participants have not interacted with one another. In this article we demonstrate the use of surrogate data generation methodology as a means of testing new null-hypotheses for synchrony between bivariate time series such as those derived from modern motion tracking methods. Hypotheses generated by surrogate data generation methods are more nuanced and meaningful than hypotheses from standard null-hypothesis testing. We review four surrogate data generation methods for testing for signiﬁcant nonverbal synchrony within a windowed cross-correlation (WCC) framework. We also interpret the null-hypotheses generated by these surrogate data generation methods with respect to nonverbal synchrony as a speciﬁc use of surrogate data generation, which can then be generalized for hypothesis testing other repeated observation psychological data.",

      "abstractNote": "Objective: The social present is a novel descriptor of dyadic nowness and social sharing, extending research on individual nowness (James’s [1890] specious present) to the interpersonal and intersubjective domain. We wished to connect this descriptor to personality attributes.\nMethod: We deﬁne the social present by the duration of signiﬁcant nonverbal synchrony, based on the phenomenon of movement synchrony that generally emerges in social interactions. It is thus an implicit and objective measure that can be implemented by automated video analyses. In this study, 168 healthy participants were invited to verbal conversations in same-sex dyads. We analyzed the associations of the social present with personality attributes and interaction types (competition, cooperation, fun task).\nResults: The average duration of the social present was 6.0 seconds, highest in competitive interactions and in male-male dyads. People with higher Openness to Experience, higher avoidant attachment, and lower narcissistic interpersonal styles showed extended social present in their interactions.\nConclusions: The concept of the social present extends personality attributes to the interpersonal domain and to intersubjectivity. The social present may be computed based on movement synchrony but also prosodic or physiological synchronies. We foresee implications for health-related interactions such as psychotherapy, where therapeutic presence is an essential property of alliance.",

Findings: Results suggest that nonverbal synchrony is signiﬁcantly associated with confrontational ruptures and that therapists may seek higher levels of nonverbal synchrony with patients to maintain a strong alliance in the face of difﬁculties. Meaning: The study highlights the potential of nonverbal synchrony to serve as a marker of confrontational ruptures in the alliance. Next Steps: After being validated by future studies, the current ﬁndings may be implemented as an in-session live feedback system that would provide therapists and patients feedback on their nonverbal markers of alliance ruptures. This could help clinicians interpret complex processes, detect and evaluate confrontation ruptures, and address the ruptures.",

We used Motion Energy Analysis to examine Social Motor Synchrony (SMS) in familiar partners of the same neurotype: pairs of autistic and of neurotypical children. Partners played two shared tablet activities, one to support collaboration by facilitating engagement and other-awareness (Connect), and one with no additional design features to facilitate collaboration (Colours). The neurotypical group showed similar SMS to the autistic group in Colours but lower SMS in Connect. The autistic group displayed similar levels of SMS in each activity. Autistic children can synchronise to a similar, or greater, degree than neurotypical children when the social context and type of task are considered.",

      "abstractNote": "We explore Peirce’s pragmatic conception of sign action, as a distributed and emergent view of cognition and exemplify with the emergence of classical ballet. In our approach, semiosis is a temporally distributed process in which a regular tendency towards certain future outcomes emerges out of a history of sign actions. Semiosis self-organizes in time, in a process that continuously entails the production of more signs. Emergence is a ubiquitous condition in this process: the translation of signs into signs cannot be inferred from the properties of the components of a semiotic triad alone, but has to take into account a complex interaction between a micro-semiotic and macro-semiotic level of description. This interaction can be understood as an interplay of potentialities and tendencies, or upward constitutive determinative relations and downward selective determinative relations. According to this view, emergence is a central defining condition of processes of meaning.",

      "abstractNote": "Background: Postural balance (PB) is an important component skill for professional dancers. However, the effects of different types of postures and different underfoot surfaces on PB have not been adequately addressed. Purpose: The main aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of different conditions of footwear, surfaces, and standing positions on static and dynamic PB ability of young ballet dancers. Method: Thirty-six male and female young professional ballet dancers (aged 14-19) completed static and dynamic balance testing, measured by head and lumbar accelerometers, while standing on one leg in the turn-out position, under six different conditions: 1. “relaxed” posture; 2. “ballet” posture; 3. barefoot; 4. ballet shoes with textured insoles; 5. barefoot on a textured mat; 6. barefoot on a spiky mat. Results: A condition effect was found for static and dynamic PB. Static PB was reduced when dancers stood in the “ballet” posture compared with standing in the “relaxed” posture, and when standing on a textured mat and on a spiky mat (p<.05); and, Static PB in the “relaxed” posture was significantly better than PB in all the other five conditions tested. Dynamic PB was significantly better while standing in ballet shoes with textured insoles and when standing on a spiky mat, compared with all other conditions (p<.05). Conclusions: The practical implications derived from the present study are that both male and female dancers should try to be “relaxed” in their postural muscles when practicing a “ballet” aligned position; including dance practice on different types of floors and on different types of textured/spiky materials may result in skill transfer to practice on normal floor surfaces; and, both static and dynamic PB exercises should be assessed and generalized into practical dance routines.",

      "abstractNote": "Ballet, the art form, is underpinned by a codified technique – a set of movements, positions and aesthetics. For centuries, ballet technique has been used to develop movement accuracy and artistry in generations of dancers. Volumes have been written on the schema of ballet technique and pedagogical approaches to achieving dance artistry. This paper considers how dancers achieve the movement accuracy demanded by ballet technique within the inherent and essential variability of functioning human body systems and according to the inevitable individuality of each human body. What role do variable biological mechanisms play in the pursuit of this advanced human ability? Using an exemplar analysis of the pirouette, we discuss how the human body’s innate movement variability can be integrated with ballet technique. Awareness of this integration has the potential to inform the pedagogical processes employed by dance educators, thereby focusing dancers’ aspirations towards the integration of their innate movement strategies within ballet technique. Each dancer develops a subtle, individual movement signature, and ballet dancers are afforded the opportunity to shape ballet in their own image.",

      "abstractNote": "This study investigates the relational dynamics of embodied agency in the empirical context of ballet. Drawing on 15 ethnographic and 6 photo-elicitation interviews with professional dancers from the Finnish National Ballet, this study analyses the ways in which ballet dancers negotiate their agency in relation to other agents in their everyday work. We show how ballet dancers have to balance between satisfying the needs of the invisible gaze through different layers of relationality, on the one hand, and aiming to create room for their intimate, embodied experiences on the other. This study contributes to the existing knowledge on agency at the workplace by illustrating how it is grounded in the body in relational ways. By furthering the phenomenological understanding of subject formation as a form of intersubjectivity, this study shows how the working self is always relationally constructed, open to ambiguity and, sometimes, ‘caught between’ achieving agency and the objectifying scrutiny of the self and others between the visible onstage and hidden backstage. Consequently, this study offers in-depth insights into and parallels for intersubjective development in organisations.",

Both fluid dynamics and ballet are concerned with flowing, continuous motion -- of fluid and of the human body, respectively. Furthermore, ballet scenes are often highly symmetric, as are cellular patterns in fluid dynamics. We present a series of images of flow patterns in a partially filled horizontally rotating cylinder (including two new cellular patterns), and of scenes from famous ballets such as “Swan Lake” and “The Nutcracker”. We will also talk about multimedia and the use of hightech tools in fluid dynamics and ballet, in creating and capturing the images.",

      "abstractNote": "Many different methodological approaches have been proposed to infer the presence of consciousness in non-human systems. In this paper, a version of the theory-heavy approach is defended. Theory-heavy approaches rely heavily on considerations from theories of consciousness to make inferences about non-human consciousness. Recently, the theory-heavy approach has been critiqued in the form of Birch's (Noûs, 56(1): 133-153, 2022) dilemma of demandingness and Shevlin's (Mind & Language, 36(2): 297-314, 2021) specificity problem. I argue that an alternative characterization of the approach avoids these challenges; a so-called credence-based theory-heavy approach. Theorists can generate interpretations of their theory, at different levels of generality, and operationalize these into theory-informed markers. These theory-informed are assigned a likelihood and are used to assess the probability that a target system is conscious. In addition, some remaining challenges for this approach are discussed, most notably a consensus problem and the problem of calibrating the likelihoods associated with theory-informed markers. Lastly, I explore methodological pluralism and assess how the credence-based theory-heavy approach can benefit from other methodological approaches.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper addresses the issue of “being together,” and more speciﬁcally the issue of “being together in time.” We provide with an integrative framework that is inspired by phenomenology, the enactive approach and dynamical systems theories. To do so, we ﬁrst deﬁne embodiment as a living and lived phenomenon that emerges from agentworld coupling. We then show that embodiment is essentially dynamical and therefore we describe experiential, behavioral and brain dynamics. Both lived temporality and the temporality of the living appear to be complex, multiscale phenomena. Next we discuss embodied dynamics in the context of interpersonal interactions, and brieﬂy review the empirical literature on between-persons temporal coordination. Overall, we propose that being together in time emerges from the relational dynamics of embodied interactions and their ﬂexible co-regulation.",

      "abstractNote": "Complexity matching is a measure of coordination based on information exchange between complex networks. To date, studies have focused mainly on interpersonal coordination, but complexity matching may generalize to interacting networks within individuals. The present study examined complexity matching in a double, coordinated Fitts’ perceptual-motor task with comparable individual and dyadic conditions. Participants alternated touching targets with their left and right hands in the individual condition, or analogously with the left hand of one partner and the right hand of another in the dyadic condition. In Experiment 1, response coupling was manipulated by making targets drift either randomly or contingently based on prior responses. Here, drift refers to the variability in the target movements between response locations. Long-range correlations in time series of inter-response intervals exhibited complexity matching between the left and right hands of dyads and individuals. Response coupling was necessary for complexity matching in dyads but not individuals. When response coupling was absent in the dyadic condition, the degree of complexity matching was significantly reduced. Experiment 2 showed that the effect of coupling was due to interactions between left and right responses. Results also showed a weak, negative relationship between complexity matching and performance as measured by total response time. In conclusion, principles and measures of complexity matching apply similarly within and between individuals, and perceptual-motor performance can be facilitated by loose response coupling.",

      "abstractNote": "Rhythmic coordination with stimuli and other people’s movements containing variable or unpredictable fluctuations might involve distinct processes: detecting the fluctuation structure and tuning to or matching the structure’s temporal complexity. This framework predicts that global tuning and local parameter adjustments (e.g., position, velocity or phase) can operate independently during coordination (Marmelat & Delignières, 2012). Alternatively, we propose that complexity matching is a result of local phase adjustments during coordination (Delignières & Marmelat, 2014; Torre, Varlet, & Marmelat, 2013). The current study examined this relationship in a rhythmic interpersonal coordination task. Dyads coordinated swinging pendulums that differed in their uncoupled frequencies (detuning). We predicted that frequency detuning would require increased local corrections to maintain the intended phase pattern (in phase). This was expected to yield a relative phase shift accompanied by a change in period complexity and matching. Experimental data and numerical modeling of the pendulum dynamics confirmed our predictions. Increased relative phase shifts occurred simultaneously with increased dissociation between individuals’ movement period complexity. This provided evidence that global complexity matching is intricately linked to local movement adjustments and is not a distinct coordination mechanism. These findings are considered with respect to dynamical and computational approaches to interpersonal coordination.",

All these forms of behavioral matching have been hypothesized to play a supportive role in establishing coordination and common ground between interlocutors. In the present study, evidence is found for a new kind of coordination termed complexity matching. Temporal dynamics in conversational speech signals were analyzed through time series of acoustic onset events. Timing in periods of acoustic energy was found to exhibit behavioral matching that reflects complementary timing in turn-taking. In addition, acoustic onset times were found to exhibit power law clustering across a range of timescales, and these power law functions were found to exhibit complexity matching that is distinct from behavioral matching. Complexity matching is discussed in terms of interactive alignment and other theoretical principles that lead to new hypotheses about information exchange in dyadic conversation and interaction in general.",

      "abstractNote": "The complexity matching effect supposes that synchronization between complex systems could emerge from multiple interactions across multiple scales and has been hypothesized to underlie a number of daily-life situations. Complexity matching suggests that coupled systems tend to share similar scaling properties, and this phenomenon is revealed by a statistical matching between the scaling exponents that characterize the respective behaviors of both systems. However, some recent papers suggested that this statistical matching could originate from local adjustments or corrections, rather than from a genuine complexity matching between systems. In the present paper, we propose an analysis method based on correlation between multifractal spectra, considering different ranges of time scales. We analyze several datasets collected in various situations (bimanual coordination, interpersonal coordination, and walking in synchrony with a fractal metronome). Our results show that this method is able to distinguish between situations underlain by genuine statistical matching and situations where statistical matching results from local adjustments.",

      "abstractNote": "The ecological approach to psychology has been a main antecedent of embodied and situated approaches to cognition. The concept of affordances in particular has gained currency throughout psychological science. Yet contemporary ecological psychology has seemed inaccessible to outsiders and protective of its legacy. Indeed, some prominent ecological psychologists have presented their approach as a “package deal”—a principled and unified perspective on perception and action. Looking at the history of the field, however, we argue that ecological psychology has developed in rich and pluriform ways. Aiming to open the field to critical engagement and productive exchange, we identify three major strands of thought within ecological psychology, each of which emerged in the 20 years after Gibson’s death: physical, biological and social ecological psychology. Each of these strands develop ecological ideas in quite different directions, making different use of some of its central concepts, adopting different explanatory principles, and embodying different philosophical worldviews. Proponents of the ecological approach have been arguing for pluralism within cognitive science to make room for ecological psychology. Given the diversity of the strands, we extend this plea to within ecological psychology itself; the field is better off aiming for a productive pluralism in which the different strands are in dialogue with each other.",

Accordingly, rather than taking a widely accepted starting point for granted and using it in order to propose answers to some well defined questions, I must first establish that the idea of life-mind continuity can amount to a proper starting point at all. To begin with, I therefore assess the conceptual tools which are available to construct a theory of mind on this basis. By drawing on insights from a variety of disciplines, especially from a combination of existential phenomenology and organism-centered biology, I argue that mind can indeed be conceived as rooted in life, but only if we accept at the same time that social interaction plays a constitutive role for our cognitive capacities.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper examines two questions related to autopoiesis as a theory for minimal life: (i) the relation between autopoiesis and cognition; and (ii) the question as to whether autopoiesis is the necessary and sufficient condition for life. First, we consider the concept of cognition in the spirit of Maturana and Varela: in contradistinction to the representationalistic point of view, cognition is construed as interaction between and mutual definition of a living unit and its environment. The most direct form of cognition for a cell is thus metabolism itself, which necessarily implies exchange with the environment and therefore a simultaneous coming to being for the organism and for the environment. A second level of cognition is recognized in the adaptation of the living unit to new foreign molecules, by way of a change in its metabolic pattern. We draw here an analogy with the ideas developed by Piaget, who recognizes in cognition the two distinct steps of assimilation and accommodation. While\n              assimilation\n              is the equivalent of uptake and exchange of usual metabolites,\n              accommodation\n              corresponds to biological adaptation, which in turn is the basis for evolution. By comparing a micro-organism with a vesicle that uptakes a precursor for its own self-reproduction, we arrive at the conclusion that (a) the very lowest level of cognition is the condition for life, and (b) the lowest level of cognition does not reduce to the lowest level of autopoiesis. As a consequence, autopoiesis alone is only a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for life. The broader consequences of this analysis of cognition for minimal living systems are considered.",

The emphasis on autonomy and autopoiesis, together with the associated idea of organisational closure, might evoke the impression that organisms are to be categorised ontologically as substances: ontologically independent, well-individuated, discrete particulars. However, I argue that this is mistaken. Autopoiesis and biological autonomy, properly understood, require a rigorous commitment to a process ontological view of life.",

      "abstractNote": "Higher education research frequently refers to the complex external conditions that give our old-fashioned universities a good reason to change. The underlying theoretical assumption of such framing is that organizations are open systems. This paper presents an alternative view, derived from the theory of social systems autopoiesis. It proposes that organizations, being open systems, are yet operationally closed, as all their activities and interactions with the environment are aspects of just one process: the recursive production of themselves, according to a pattern of their own identity. It is their identity that captures exactly what can and what cannot be sustained in their continuous self-production. Examining the organizational identity of universities within the theoretical framework of autopoiesis may hence shed new light on their resistance to change, explaining it as a systemic and social phenomenon, rather than an individual and psychological one. Since all processes of an autopoietic system are processes of its selfproduction, this paper argues that in the case of traditional European universities, the identity consists in the intertwinement of only two processes: (1) introducing continuous change in the scope of scientiﬁc knowledge and (2) educating new generations of scholars, who will carry on this activity. This surprisingly leaves at the wayside seemingly the most obvious ‘use of the university’: the adequate education of students for the job market.",

      "abstractNote": "Cognitive science's basic premises are under attack. In particular, its focus on internal cognitive processes is a target. Intelligence is increasingly interpreted, not as a matter of reclusive thought, but as successful agent-environment interaction. The critics claim that a major reorientation of the field is necessary. However, this will only occur when there is a distinct alternative conceptual framework to replace the old one. Whether or not a serious alternative is provided is not clear. Among the critics there is some consensus, however, that this role could be fulfilled by the concept of a 'behavioral system'. This integrates agent and environment into one encompassing general system. We will discuss two contexts in which the behavioral systems idea is being developed. Autonomous Agents Research is the enterprise of building behavior-based robots. Dynamical Systems Theory provides a mathematical framework well suited for describing the interactions between complex systems. We will conclude that both enterprises provide important contributions to the behavioral systems idea. But neither turns it into a full conceptual alternative which will initiate a major paradigm switch in cognitive science. The concept will need a lot of fleshing out before it can assume that role.",

      "abstractNote": "We present a theory of cooperative-competitive intelligence (CCI), its measures, research program, and applications that stem from it. Within the framework of this theory, satisficing sub-optimal behavior is any behavior that does not promote a decrease in the prospective control of the functional action diversity/unpredictability (D/U) potential of the agent or team. This potential is defined as the entropy measure in multiple, context-dependent dimensions. We define the satisficing interval of behaviors as CCI. In order to manifest itself at individual or team level, this capacity harnesses properties such as degeneracy, pleiotropy (pluri-potentiality), synergies, and metastability. Intelligence is embodied because intelligent behavior is deeply dependent on body functionalities, defined as entropy measures. We base our theory on three principles: (a) relativity of functional entropy/ information in agent (team)-environment systems, (b) tendency toward the satisficing level of D/U potential, and (c) tendency toward the non-decreasing D/U potential. The conjunction of these three principles provides existence of sub-optimal behaviors associated with CCI. First, we deal with the problem of how to reduce multidimensional behavior to a concept that accounts for the vast set of scenarios in which CCI is manifested. Secondly, we define and discuss the three interacting principles that underpin CCI behavior as well as providing an outline for a future CCI research program supported by agentbased modeling and empirical research. Finally, we provide some preliminary practical issues that stem from the theory.",

In Experiment 1, left-handed and right-handed participants (N = 36) repeatedly used one hand for grasping a small cube. After a clear switch in the cube’s location, perseverative limb selection was revealed in both handedness groups. In Experiment 2, the cubes were presented in a clockwise and counterclockwise sequence to right-handed participants (N = 15). A spatial shift in the switch point between right-hand use and left-hand use was observed. The model simulates the experiments by implementing the nonlinear multiple-timescale dynamics of the action-selection process underlying limb selection. It integrates two mechanisms that were earlier proposed to underlie this selection aspect of manual activity: limb dominance and attentional information. Finally, the model is used to simulate an inﬂuential earlier experiment, by establishing a conceptual link between cross-lateral inhibition asymmetry and the direction and strength of handedness.",

      "abstractNote": "Experiences of collective creative activities play an essential role in human societies, yet these experiences are particularly hard to capture, making their scientific scrutiny extremely challenging. Here we investigate the experience of audience members during a musical concert associated with collective improvisation by analysing the audience's subjective reports and movement patterns. Our results show that performance with improvisational elements affect movement synchronisation dynamics between performers and audience members differently at different timescales, which are predictive of changes in the subjective perception of music. These results provide a first step towards the quantification of some of the fundamental aspects of these collective experiences. Moreover, the reported findings shed new light on the relevance of the often-neglected multiscale coordination between audiences and performers, and explains how this rich tapestry of physical behaviour is connected with the quality of the collective subjective experience.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent advances in neuroscience have linked dynamical systems theory to cognition. The main contention is that extended cognition relies on a unitary brain-body-tool system showing the expected signatures of interaction-dominance reﬂected in a multifractal behavior. This might be particularly relevant when it comes to understanding how the brain is able to embody a tool to perform a task. Here we applied the multifractal formalism to the dynamics of hand movement while one was performing a computer task (the herding task) using a mouse or its own hand as a tool to move an object on the screen. We applied a focus-based multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation analysis to acceleration time series. Then, multifractal nonlinearity was assessed by comparing original series to a ﬁnite set of surrogates obtained after Iterated Amplitude Adjusted Fourier transformation, a method that removes nonlinear multiscale dependencies while preserving the linear structure of the time series. Both hand and mouse task execution demonstrated multifractal nonlinearity, a typical form of across-scales interactivity in cognitive control. In addition, a wider multifractal spectrum was observed in mouse condition, which might highlight a richer set of interactions when the cognitive system is extended to the embodied mouse. We conclude that the emergence of multifractal nonlinearity from a brain-body-tool system pleads for recent theories of radical tool embodiment. Multifractal nonlinearity may be a promising metric to appreciate how physical objects—but also virtual tools and potentially prosthetics—are efﬁciently embodied by the brain.",

      "abstractNote": "There is some evidence that an improved understanding of executive control in the human movement system could be gained from explorations based on scale-free, fractal analysis of cyclic motor time series. Such analyses capture non-linear fractal dynamics in temporal ﬂuctuations of motor instances that are believed to reﬂect how executive control enlist a coordination of multiple interactions across temporal scales between the brain, the body and the task environment, an essential architecture for adaptation. Here by recruiting elite rugby players with high motor skills and submitting them to the execution of rhythmic motor tasks involving legs and arms concurrently, the main attempt was to build on the multifractal formalism of movement control to show a marginal need of effective adaptation in concurrent tasks, and a preserved adaptability despite complexiﬁed motor execution. The present study applied a multifractal analytical approach to experimental time series and added surrogate data testing based on shufﬂed, ARFIMA, Davies&Harte and phase-randomized surrogates, for assessing scale-free behavior in repeated motor time series obtained while combining cycling with ﬁnger tapping and with circling. Single-tasking was analyzed comparatively. A focus-based multifractal-DFA approach provided Hurst exponents (H) of individual time series over a range of statistical moments H(q), q = [−15 15]. H(2) quantiﬁed monofractality and H(-15)-H(15) provided an index of multifractality. Despite concurrent tasking, participants showed great capacity to keep the target rhythm. Surrogate data testing showed reasonable reliability in using multifractal formalism to decipher movement control behavior. The global (i.e., monofractal) behavior in single-tasks did not change when adapting to dual-task. Multifractality dominated in cycling and did not change when cycling was challenged by upper limb movements. Likewise, tapping and circling behaviors were preserved despite concurrent cycling. It is concluded that the coordinated executive control when adapting to dual-motor tasking is not modiﬁed in people having developed great motor skills through physical training. Executive control likely emerged from multiplicative interactions across temporal scales which puts emphasis on multifractal approaches of the movement system to get critical cues on adaptation. Extending such analyses to less skilled people is appealing in the context of exploring healthy and diseased movement systems.",

      "abstractNote": "Fractal structures are found in biomedical time series from a wide range of physiological phenomena. The multifractal spectrum identiﬁes the deviations in fractal structure within time periods with large and small ﬂuctuations. The present tutorial is an introduction to multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (MFDFA) that estimates the multifractal spectrum of biomedical time series. The tutorial presents MFDFA step-by-step in an interactive Matlab session. All Matlab tools needed are available in Introduction to MFDFA folder at the website www.ntnu.edu/inm/geri/software. MFDFA are introduced in Matlab code boxes where the reader can employ pieces of, or the entire MFDFA to example time series. After introducing MFDFA, the tutorial discusses the best practice of MFDFA in biomedical signal processing. The main aim of the tutorial is to give the reader a simple self-sustained guide to the implementation of MFDFA and interpretation of the resulting multifractal spectra.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent research has clariﬁed the existence of a networked system involving a cortical and subcortical circuitry regulating both cognition and cardiac autonomic control, which is dynamically organized as a function of cognitive demand. The main interactions span multiple temporal and spatial scales and are extensively governed by nonlinear processes. Hence, entropy and (multi)fractality in heart period time series are suitable to capture emergent behavior of the cognitive-autonomic network coordination. This study investigated how entropy and multifractal-multiscale analyses could depict speciﬁc cognitive-autonomic architectures reﬂected in the heart rate dynamics when students performed selective inhibition tasks. The participants (N = 37) completed cognitive interference (Stroop color and word task), action cancellation (stop-signal) and action restraint (go/no-go) tasks, compared to watching a neutral movie as baseline. Entropy and fractal markers (respectively, the reﬁned composite multiscale entropy and multifractal-multiscale detrended ﬂuctuation analysis) outperformed other time-domain and frequency-domain markers of the heart rate variability in distinguishing cognitive tasks. Crucially, the entropy increased selectively during cognitive interference and the multifractality increased during action cancellation. An interpretative hypothesis is that cognitive interference elicited a greater richness in interactive processes that form the central autonomic network while action cancellation, which is achieved via biasing a sensorimotor network, could lead to a scale-speciﬁc heightening of multifractal behavior.",

Application of this geometry relies heavily on the estimation of the fractal features. Various methods were proposed to estimate the fractal dimension or multifractal spectral of a signal. This article presents an overview of these algorithms, the way they work, their beneﬁts and their limits. The aim of this review is to explain and to categorize the various algorithms into groups and their application in the ﬁeld of medical signal analysis.",

      "abstractNote": "With the mounting realization that variability is an inevitable part of human behavior comes the need to integrate this phenomenon in concomitant models and theories of motor control. Among other things, this has resulted in a debate throughout the last decades about the origin of variability in behavior, the outcome of which has important implications for motor control theories. To date, a monofractal formalism of variability has been used as the basis for arguing for component- versus interaction-oriented theories of motor control. However, monofractal formalism alone cannot decide between the opposing sides of the debate. The present theoretical overview introduces multifractal formalisms as a necessary extension of the conventional monofractal formalism. In multifractal formalisms, the scale invariance of behavior is numerically deﬁned as a spectrum of scaling exponents, rather than a single average exponent as in the monofractal formalism. Several methods to estimate the multifractal spectrum of scaling exponents – all within two multifractal formalisms called large deviation and Legendre formalism – are introduced and brieﬂy discussed. Furthermore, the multifractal analyses within these two formalisms are applied to several performance tasks to illustrate how explanations of motor control vary with the methods used. The main section of the theoretical overview discusses the implications of multifractal extensions of the component- and interaction-oriented models for existing theories of motor control.

      "abstractNote": "This paper provides evidence for a radically enactive, embodied account of remembering. By looking closely at highly context-dependent instances of memorizing and recalling dance material, I aim at shedding light on the workings of memory. Challenging the view that cognition fundamentally entails contentful mental representation, the examples I discuss attest the existence of non-representational instances of memory, accommodating episodic memory. That being so, this paper also makes room for content-involving forms of remembering. As a result, it supports the duplex vision of mentality advanced by the REC framework. Building on research on the enactive imagination, I suggest that contentless forms of remembering act below content-involving forms. In addition, contentless and contentful forms of remembering a movement are revealed as the product of culturally scaffolded engagements with others and the environment, in which direct perception and mirroring play a fundamental role. It is argued that many of the practices of remembering a movement are best explained as enactments or re-enactments of such direct ecological perceptions. In the process, the dance studio proves to be a paradigm of the extensive mind. This paper is also intended as an invitation to the REC framework to extend the family and explicitly embrace research on sociocultural practices as an equal partner, including dance studies. Given the fundamental role that sociocultural practices play in REC’s understanding of cognition, it is only natural that further radicalization goes along those lines.",

      "abstractNote": "We investigated the coupling between a speaker’s and a listener’s eye movements. Some participants talked extemporaneously about a television show whose cast members they were viewing on a screen in front of them. Later, other participants listened to these monologues while viewing the same screen. Eye movements were recorded for all speakers and listeners. According to cross-recurrence analysis, a listener’s eye movements most closely matched a speaker’s eye movements at a delay of 2 sec. Indeed, the more closely a listener’s eye movements were coupled with a speaker’s, the better the listener did on a comprehension test. In a second experiment, low-level visual cues were used to manipulate the listeners’ eye movements, and these, in turn, influenced their latencies to comprehension questions. Just as eye movements reflect the mental state of an individual, the coupling between a speaker’s and a listener’s eye movements reflects the success of their communication.",

      "abstractNote": "In this study, we define team agility as a function of exploration and exploitation of team coordination. Based on these two coordination concepts, we examined interactive decisionmaking in a dynamic task environment by applying: (1) the principles of quantum cognition for the decision-making processes at the confluence of teamwork and taskwork (to discern the effects of ontic uncertainty for each human team member in the case of having incomplete teamwork) and (2) nonlinear dynamical systems modeling for the teamwork (to capture epistemic uncertainty). In this study, there were three conditions based on manipulation of the pilot role: (1) synthetic condition - the pilot role was played by a synthetic agent, (2) control condition - it was a randomly assigned participant, and (3) experimenter condition - it was an expert who used a role-specific coordination script. Overall findings indicate that when teams in the experimenter condition come across the targets, they tend to explore alternatives by coordinating as a team rather than exploiting existing team strategies which may not work best for the situation at hand. In contrast, teams in control and synthetic conditions tended more towards exploitation than exploration in coordination. We consider this a sign of agility in teamwork.",

      "abstractNote": "Emotional self-regulation involves different systems (such as motor, attentional and cognitive) interacting in time to influence emotional behaviour and physiology. We investigated differences in emotional self-regulation during the still-face paradigm in 111 9month-old infants (61 term; 50 preterm, <33 weeks of gestation), in the amount of emotional self-regulatory behaviours, as well as the micro-level (obtained using recurrence quantification analysis) and macro-level behavioural dynamics (differences under repeated stress). Preterm birth was associated with fewer repetitive movements, and lower gestational age increased this effect. Unlike that of term-born infants, the behaviour of preterm-born infants changed under repeated stress, leading to fewer object-oriented attentional distraction strategies, fewer repetitive movements, and greater oral-tactile self-comforting strategies. No differences in micro-level behavioural dynamics, or socially-oriented regulatory behaviours were found. Prematurity results in greater regulatory “brakes” on emotional expression with repetitive movements, and emotional self-regulatory capacities may be more vulnerable to the nature of environmental stress.",

      "abstractNote": "Within the last 20 years, transitions in the conceptualization of emotion and its development have given rise to calls for an explanatory framework that captures emotional development in all its organizational complexity and variability. Recent attempts have been made to couch emotional development in terms of a dynamical systems approach through utilization of principles like selforganization and emergence. In this article, we review and evaluate these attempts, both at the level of theoretical framework and empirical instantiation. We trace the dynamic systems approach to emotional development from theoretical origins in the work of Fogel and WolV to the more recent framework of Lewis. We also chart its empirical applications from the standpoint of research strategy speciWc to the approach. We also explore the challenges this approach faces in promoting its framework as both unique and beneWcial to the study of stability and change in emotion.",

      "abstractNote": "Resilience is still often viewed as a unitary personality construct that, as a kind of antinosological entity, protects individuals against stress-related mental problems. However, increasing evidence indicates that maintaining mental health in the face of adversity results from complex and dynamic processes of adaptation to stressors that involve the activation of several separable protective factors. Such resilience factors can reside at biological, psychological, and social levels and may include stable predispositions (such as genotype or personality traits) and malleable properties, skills, capacities, or external circumstances (such as gene-expression patterns, emotion-regulation abilities, appraisal styles, or social support). We abandon the notion of resilience as an entity here. Starting from a conceptualization of psychiatric disorders as dynamic networks of interacting symptoms that may be driven by stressors into stable maladaptive states of disease, we deconstruct the maintenance of mental health during stressor exposure into timevariant dampening influences of resilience factors onto these symptom networks. Resilience factors are separate additional network nodes that weaken symptom–symptom interconnections or symptom autoconnections, thereby preventing maladaptive system transitions. We argue that these hybrid symptom-and-resilience-factor networks provide a promising new way of unraveling the complex dynamics of mental health.",

      "abstractNote": "One can be reproached for not remembering. Remembering and forgetting shows who and what one values. Indeed, memory is constitutively normative. Theoretical approaches to memory should be sensitive to this normative character. We will argue that traditional views that consider memory as the storing and retrieval of mental content, fail to consider the practices we need for telling the truth about our past. We introduce the Radically Enactive view of Cognition, or REC, as well-placed to recognize the central role of norms in remembering. Crucially, REC construes all remembering as “something we do”, and the most sophisticated forms of remembering as things we collectively do, answerable to socioculturally established practices. On this view our mnemonic performances cannot avoid re-shaping our collective ways of doing and seeing going forward. By REC’s lights therefore, the “is” of memory is “oughty” through and through.",

      "abstractNote": "Insights, characterized by sudden discoveries following unsuccessful problem-solving attempts, are fascinating phenomena. Dynamic systems perspectives argue that insight arises from self-organizing perceptual and motor processes. Entropy and fractal scaling are potential markers for emerging new and effective solutions. This study investigated whether specific features associated with self-organization in dynamical systems can distinguish between individuals who succeed and those who fail in solving insight tasks. To achieve this, we analyzed pupillary diameter fluctuations of children aged 6 to 12 during the 8-coin task, a well-established insight task. The participants were divided into two groups: successful (\n              n\n              = 24) and unsuccessful (\n              n\n              = 43) task completion. Entropy, determinism, recurrence ratio, and the β scaling exponent were estimated using Recurrence Quantification and Power Spectrum Density analyses. The results indicated that the solver group exhibited more significant uncertainty and lower predictability in pupillary diameter fluctuations before finding the solution. Recurrence Quantification Analysis revealed changes that went unnoticed by mean and standard deviation measures. However, the β scaling exponent did not differentiate between the two groups. These findings suggest that entropy and determinism in pupillary diameter fluctuations can identify early differences in problem-solving success. Further research is needed to determine the exclusive role of perceptual and motor activity in generating insights and investigate these results’ generalizability to other tasks and populations.",

      "abstractNote": "A complex dynamic systems perspective was applied to explore how mother and child mutually shape interpersonal coordination. Applying a microanalytic design, this study examined the moment-to-moment interaction behavior of 39 Dutch mothers and their three- and four-yearold children (53.8% girls, predominantly White) during a collaboration task. Fine-grained time-series data were extracted about the verbal, affec­ tive, and body movement modalities. Research Findings: Cross-recurrence quantification analysis showed that mothers and children were coupled within all three modalities. Recurrent behaviors were found with varying delays, spanning from the immediate to the entire length of the interac­ tion. Many of the interactions were characterized by a certain degree of patternedness, whereby the amount of patternedness varied substantially between dyads. Measures of interpersonal coordination were not asso­ ciated between modalities. Practice or Policy: Next to the content of interaction behavior (e.g., what a parent actually says), practitioners should also consider how behaviors of a mother and her child vary together. Thereby, an appraisal of the caregiver–child relationship should not merely focus on caregiving behavior, but acknowledge the active and autonomous involvement of the child. It remains to be investigated how different patterns of interpersonal coordination may serve as a diagnostic marker of (mal)adaptive child development.",

This will be done by taking an embodied approach to reading and by applying the tools of complex dynamical systems theory. By doing this we aim to overpass the measurement issue of metacognition and see if metacognitive feelings of confusion and the usage of metacognitive strategies is reflected in eye and body movement.\nMethod: We will measure the eye and body movements of undergraduate and PhD students during three increasingly difficult reading tasks. Participants will be asked to complete a series of comprehension questions and the Revised Metacognitive Awareness of Reading Strategies Inventory (Mokhtari et. al, 2018). Dynamical characteristics (multifractality, recurrence rate, entropy and determinism) of the eye and body movements will be compared between groups and conditions. The relation between the dynamic characteristics and comprehension and metacognition scores will also be explored.\nResults: N/A\nConclusions: N/A",

      "abstractNote": "The background noise of response times is often overlooked in scientific inquiries of cognitive performances. However, it is becoming widely acknowledged in psychology, medicine, physiology, physics, and beyond that temporal patterns of variability constitute a rich source of information. Here, we introduce two complexity measures (1/f scaling and recurrence quantification analysis) that employ background noise as metrics of reading fluency. These measures gauge the extent of interdependence across, rather than within, cognitive components. In this study, we investigated dyslexic and non-dyslexic wordnaming performance in beginning readers and observed that these complexity metrics differentiate reliably between dyslexic and average response times and correlate strongly with the severity of the reading impairment. The direction of change in the introduced metrics suggests that developmental dyslexia resides from dynamical instabilities in the coordination among the many components necessary to read, which could explain why dyslexic readers score below average on so many distinct tasks and modalities.",

      "abstractNote": "Studies of many complex systems have revealed new collective behaviours that emerge through the mechanisms of self-organised critical ﬂuctuations. Subject to the external and endogenous driving forces, these collective states with long-range spatial and temporal correlations often arise from the intrinsic dynamics with the threshold nonlinearity and geometry-conditioned interactions. The self-similarity of critical ﬂuctuations enables us to describe the system using fewer parameters and universal functions that, on the other hand, can simplify the computational and information complexity. Currently, the cutting-edge research on self-organised critical systems across the scales strives to formulate a unifying mathematical framework, utilise the critical universal properties in information theory, and decipher the role of hidden geometry. As a prominent example, we study the ﬁeld-driven spin dynamics on the hysteresis loop in a network with higher-order structures described by simplicial complexes, which provides a geometric-frustration environment. While providing motivational illustrations from physical, biological, and social systems, along with their networks, we also demonstrate how the self-organised criticality occurs at the interplay of the complex topology and driving mode. This study opens up new promising routes with powerful tools to address a long-standing challenge in the theory and applications of complexity science ingrained in the efﬁcient analysis of self-organised critical states under the competing higher-order interactions embedded in complex geometries.",

      "abstractNote": "The research project is a small pilot study of the restorative aspects of museum experience on children; these include the sense of fascination during the visit. Museum environmental awareness was a latecomer to Museum and Visitor studies but is now highly valued. No longer just the “objects” contained in the museum fascinate but also the environment itself becomes an object of fascination. Some authors provide a clear categorization of feelings experienced by the visitor during a museum experience and suggest a framework with four categories of satisfying experience: objective, cognitive, introspective, and social. In designing our study, we began with the deﬁnition of museum experience and added a ﬁfth category of “environmental experience.” With this term, we refer to the extent to which the physical environment in and around a museum affects visitors. Indeed, our aim is to analyze the visitor’s stream of feelings and opinions during a museum visit (speciﬁcally, the MART—Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto) to ﬁnd a proper deﬁnition of the aesthetic elements characterizing the “environmental preference.” To do this, we referenced classical and experimental paradigms of Environmental Psychology applied to a museum context and building aesthetic researches, combining qualitative and quantitative approaches. The case study involved 41 children, 20 male and 21 female, from two primary school classes in Rovereto (Italy); the average age was 8.3 years old.",

      "abstractNote": "The enactive approach characterizes life and cognition as sense-making. The standard description of sense-making entails the co-emergence of an agent’s self and a meaningful world, as well as the emergence of a normativity that guides the behaviour of the coupled agent-environment system. This emergent process happens at different levels of interactions: biological, sensorimotor, intercorporeal and linguistic. Sense-making therefore accounts for the natural origins of intentionality and meaning and gives continuity to the emergent enactive processes of life and mind. The standard description of sense-making is nonetheless too abstract and neglects many historical and ecological aspects relevant to the scientiﬁc study of life and mind processes as they happen in concrete ﬁelds of action. To address this issue, I propose the enlarged description of sense-making in the wild, which is based on three fundamental concepts: norm development, enactivesituated normativity and transverse emergence. Norm development deﬁnes sense-making as a historically situated process that transforms the previously given dynamical conﬁguration of the agent-environment system into a new one. Enactivesituated normativity asserts that in addition to the agent’s self-maintenance and the material constraints of the agentenvironment system, many dynamical constraints, ecologically situated, shape the origin, maintenance and development of sense-making processes. Finally, transverse emergence describes the transformational process of the whole agentenvironment system dynamically, as a reconﬁguration of the landscape of attractors that exhibit the typical behaviour of the system. Sense-making in the wild thus aims to facilitate conceptual tools to study enactive cognition, as it happens in concrete ﬁelds of action.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper considers some foundational concepts in ecological psychology and in enactivism, and traces their developments from their historical roots to current preoccupations. Important differences stem, we claim, from dissimilarities in how embodied experience has been understood by the ancestors, founders and followers of ecological psychology and enactivism, respectively. Rather than pointing to differences in domains of interest for the respective approaches, and restating possible divisions of labor between them in research in the cognitive and psychological sciences, we call for a deeper analysis of the role of embodiment in agency that we also undertake. Awareness of the differences that exist in the respective frameworks and their consequences, we argue, may lead to overcoming some current divisions of responsibility, and contribute to a more comprehensive and complementary way of dealing with a broader range of theoretical and practical concerns. While providing some examples of domains, such as social cognition and art reception, in which we can observe the relative usefulness and potential integration of the theoretical and methodological resources from the two approaches, we demonstrate that such deeper synergy is not only possible but also beginning to emerge. Such complementarity, as we envisage, conceives of ecological psychology that allows felt experience as a crucial dynamical element in the explanations and models that it produces, and of an enactive approach that takes into consideration the ubiquitous presence of rich directly perceived relations among variables arising from enactments in the social and physical world.",

Both theoretical and empirical studies are considered, with emphasis in the concept of multivariability and metastability in the brain. In this new view on the human brain, the potential multivariability of the neuronal networks appears to be far from continuous in time, but confined by the dynamics of short-term local and global metastable brain states. The article closes by suggesting some of the implications of this view in future multidisciplinary brain research.",

      "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Researchers have observed large-scale neural meta-state transitions that align to narrative events during movie-viewing. However, group or training-derived priors have been needed to detect them. Here, we introduce methods to sample transitions without any priors. Transitions detected by our methods predict narrative events, are similar across task and rest, and are correlated with activation of regions associated with spontaneous thought. Based on the centrality of semantics to thought, we argue these transitions serve as general, implicit neurobiological markers of new thoughts, and that their frequency, which is stable across contexts, approximates participants’ mentation rate. By enabling observation of idiosyncratic transitions, our approach supports many applications, including phenomenological access to the black box of resting cognition. To illustrate the utility of this access, we regress resting fMRI transition rate and movie-viewing transition conformity against trait neuroticism, thereby providing a first neural confirmation of mental noise theory.",

      "abstractNote": "Continuous interaction of mother and infant in the first weeks and months of an infant’s life entrains the infant on many crucial aspects of how to do things together. Contingencies of gaze, vocalizations, and other movements are slowly routinized; this scaffolds directing of attention to each other and the world and gives to such multimodal interactions meaning. It is within these continuous interactions with caregivers that language emerges, starting from the first nonreflexive vocalizations that infants produce. The response that caregivers promptly give to these vocalizations informs infants of their relevance and helps shape them. We explored this systematicity by observing the coupling of infants’ and mothers’ vocalizations in unconstrained interactions longitudinally. While at three months, mothers seem to answer consistently to any speech related vocalization within the first two seconds, this pattern fades away at six and eight months. What remains stable across age is a structure in which overlapping vocalizations are rare and give way to a sequential pattern of vocal reciprocity — an embryonic turn-taking behavior. Discussion relates this finding to early coordination in other modalities in an attempt to sketch a more holistic account of emerging co-action.",

      "abstractNote": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination and how agents propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modelling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between actors, whereas through EDM we conceptualised coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to RMS amplitude time series, could be used to tell apart coordinating from non-coordinating musicians. Our results also suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, i.e. as more actors in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.",

      "abstractNote": "A key emergent property of group social dynamic is synchrony–the coordination of actions, emotions, or physiological processes between group members. Despite this fact and the inherent nested structure of groups, little research has assessed physiological synchronization between group members from a multi-level perspective, thus limiting a full understanding of the dynamics between members. To address this gap of knowledge we re-analyzed a large dataset (N = 261) comprising physiological and psychological data that were collected in two laboratory studies that involved two different social group tasks. In both studies, following the group task, members reported their experience of group cohesion via questionnaires. We utilized a nonlinear analysis method-multidimensional recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis that allowed us to represent physiological synchronization in cardiological interbeat intervals between group members at the individual-level and at the group-level. We found that across studies and their conditions, the change in physiological synchrony from baseline to group interaction predicted a psychological sense of group cohesion. This result was evident both at the individual and the group levels and was not modiﬁed by the context of the interaction. The individual- and group-level effects were highly correlated. These results indicate that the relationship between synchrony and cohesion is a multilayered construct. We re-afﬁrm the role of physiological synchrony for cohesion in groups. Future studies are needed to crystallize our understanding of the differences and similarities between synchrony at the individual-level and synchrony at the group level to illuminate under which conditions one of these levels has primacy, or how they interact.",

The purpose of this chapter is threefold. First, general characteristics of dynamical systems are addressed from a theoretical mathematical perspective. Second, qualitative and quantitative recurrence analyses are reviewed in brief, but the reader is directed to other sources for explicit details. Third, example mathematical systems that generate strange attractors are explicitly deﬁned, giving the reader the ability to reproduce the rich dynamics of continuous chaotic ﬂows or discrete chaotic iterations. The challenge is then posited for the reader to study for themselves the recurrent structuring of these different dynamics. With a ﬁrm appreciation of the power of recurrence analysis, the reader will be prepared to turn their sights on real-world systems (physiological, psychological, mechanical, etc.).",

      "abstractNote": "Multiscale Regression Analysis (MRA) is a promising new tool for the analysis of bivariate time series that is based on Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. The method was developed within the economics and environmental science literatures (Kristoufek, 2015, 2018; Kristoufek and Ferreira, 2018) and is beginning to be applied in other scientific domains. To date, however, no systematic studies have investigated the behavior of the estimator with respect to short time series. This paper fills that gap by assessing the performance of the MRA estimator using time series with varying length, distribution, and structure (e.g., autocorrelation, stationarity). Simulations show that MRA performs well under many circumstances with as few as 512 observations. Linear and quadratic time trends contribute considerable systematic bias; however, using a detrending polynomial of order ≥ 2 effectively attenuates time trend associated deviations from expected values. We apply MRA to a previously published dataset in order to explore the relationship that emerges between body segments during an act of quiet standing. Results suggest that the velocity of the hip asymptotically depends on velocity of the ankle. In contrast, ankle velocity was a much weaker predictor of shoulder velocity. We conclude by providing suggestions for best practice and future model development.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper argues that psychological and social functioning is fundamentally complex, and that this complexity is critical to understanding how lasting positive changes can be achieved. Principles from complex systems theory are integrated into an empirical positive psychological framework to propose a domain-based systems model of positive change called the Synergistic Change Model. This model proposes that enduring positive change depends on the formation of mutually supportive interactions across multiple domains of psychological and social functioning. The paper uses the model to explore three types of response to intervention – relapse, spill-over, and synergy – which have been supported in the existing positive psychology literature. Three practical intervention strategies arising from the model are outlined to inform the design of future positive interventions. The model challenges reductionistic approaches to positive change and offers several approaches to embrace the complexities of lasting positive change in future theory and research.",

Although the complexity and dynamism of personal and social phenomena have long been recognized, they are difﬁcult to investigate using traditional research methods. This article provides an overview of dynamical social psychology, an approach adapted from dynamical systems theory that is designed to capture the complementary tendencies of stability and dynamism at different levels of social reality, from private thoughts to intergroup relations. Utilizing time-series analyses and computer simulations, this perspective documents the emergence of global properties from the interaction of basic elements in mental and social systems and investigates the time-dependent relation between external inﬂuences and a system’s internally generated dynamics. The dynamical approach enables social psychology to advance as a precise science while preserving the basic insights that launched the ﬁeld over a century ago.",

      "abstractNote": "The implications of conceptualizing personality as a cognitive-affective processing system that functions as a parallel constraint satisfaction network are explored. Computer simulations show that from dynamic interactions among the units in such a network, a set of stable attractor states and functionally equivalent groups of situations emerge, such that IF exposed to situation group X, THEN the system settles in attractor Y. This conceptualization explicitly models the effect of situations on a given individual, and therefore can also be used to model the function of interpersonal systems. We demonstrate this possibility by modeling dyadic systems in which one partner's behavior becomes the situational input into the other partner's personality system, and vice versa. The results indicate that each member of the dyad will, in general, exhibit new attractor states. This suggests that the thoughts, affects, and behaviors that an individual typically experiences are a function not of that individual's personality system alone, but rather a function of the interpersonal system of which the individual is a part. Just as individuals have distinctive and stable IF-THEN signatures, so do interpersonal relationships. Understanding the structure of the cognitive-affective processing system of each relationship partner also should enable predictions of their distincitve relational signatures as emergent properties of the interpersonal system that develops.",

PeopleÕs thoughts, feelings, and predispositions for action are inherently dynamic, displaying constant change due to internal mechanisms and external forces, but over time the ﬂow of thought and action converges on a narrow range of states—a ﬁxed-point attractor—that provides cognitive, aﬀective, and behavioral stability. An attractor for personal dynamics develops through two mechanisms: the synchronization of individualsÕ internal states in social interaction, and the self-organization of thoughts and feelings with respect to a higher-order property (e.g., goal, self-concept). We present formal models of both processes and instantiate each in computer simulations. Discussion centers on the implications of interpersonal synchronization and self-organization dynamics for issues in personality psychology, including shared vs. non-shared environmental inﬂuences on personality development, the expression of personality in social interaction, personal stability vs. change, personal vs. situational causation, and the emergence of self-concept.",

      "abstractNote": "One issue with the analysis of complex systems and the interaction between such systems is that they are composed of diﬀerent number of components, or simply the fact that a diﬀerent number of observables is available for each system. The challenge is how to analyze the interaction of two systems which are not described by the same number of variables. The approach is to combine diﬀerent types and number of time series so that they yield a matched set of data points from which coupling or correlation properties can be estimated. Here, we present multidimensional joint recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis (MdJRQA), a recurrence-based technique that allows to analyze coupling properties between multivariate data sets that diﬀer in dimensionality (i.e., number of observables) and type of data (such as nominal or intervalscaled, for example). First, we introduce the methods, and then test it on simulated data from linear and nonlinear systems. Finally, we discuss practical issue regarding the application of the method.",

      "abstractNote": "Recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis (RQA) is an established tool for data analysis in various behavioural sciences. In this article we present a reﬁned notion of RQA based on order patterns. The use of order patterns is commonplace in time series analysis. Exploiting this concept in combination with recurrence plots (RP) and their quantiﬁcation (RQA) allows for advances in contemporary EEG research, speciﬁcally in the analysis of event related potentials (ERP), as the method is known to be robust against non-stationary data. The use of order patterns recurrence plots (OPRPs) on EEG data recorded during a language processing experiment exempliﬁes the potentials of the method. We could show that the application of RQA to ERP data allows for a considerable reduction of the number of trials required in ERP research while still maintaining statistical validity.",

      "abstractNote": "The nature of the dynamics of nonverbal interactions is of considerable interest to the study of human communication and future human-computer interaction. Facial expressions constitute an important source of nonverbal social signals. Whereas most studies have focused on the facial expressions of isolated individuals, the aim of this study is to explore the coupling dynamics of facial expressions in social dyadic interactions. Using a special experimental set-up, the frontal facial dynamics of pairs of socially interacting persons were measured and analyzed simultaneously. We introduce the use of convergent cross mapping, a method originating from dynamical systems theory, to assess the causal coupling of the dyadic facial-expression dynamics. The results reveal the presence of bidirectional causal couplings of the facial dynamics. We conclude that convergent cross mapping yields encouraging results in establishing evidence for causal behavioral interactions.",

      "abstractNote": "The social brain, consisting of those areas sensitive to social information, has been argued to “gate” the mechanisms involved in human language learning. Early preverbal interactions are guided by ostensive signals, such as gaze patterns. However, little is known about how the infant brain processes social gaze in naturalistic interactions and how this relates to infant language development. During free play of 9-month-olds with their mothers, we recorded fNIRS hemodynamic cortical activity and micro-coded different gaze behaviors (i.e., mutual gaze, maternal or infant’s social gaze) offline. Infants’ speech processing abilities were assessed with a word segmentation task. Using multidimensional joint recurrence quantification analysis (MdJRQA), we examined which gaze type was related to the highest infant’s hemodynamic cortical activity, in terms of Recurrence Rate. Regression modeling revealed that maternal social gaze co-occurred more often with the infant’s cortical activity compared to the other gaze types. Moreover, using recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) we found that maternal social gaze also was the gaze behavior that best predicted infant’s word segmentation in terms of Entropy. The findings further support the importance of social interaction in language development, particularly highlighting maternal social gaze.",

      "abstractNote": "Self-organizing systems are social systems which are immanently and constantly recreated by agents. In a selforganizing system, agents make changes while preserving stability. If they do not preserve stability, they push the system toward chaos and cannot recreate it. How changes preserve stability is thus a fundamental issue. In current works, changes preserve stability because agents’ ability to make changes is limited by interaction rules and power. However, how agents diffuse the changes throughout the system while preserving its stability has not been addressed in these works. We have addressed this issue by borrowing from a complex system theory neglected thus far in organization theories: self-organized criticality theory. We suggest that self-organizing systems are in critical states: agents have equivalent ability to make changes, and none are able to foresee or control how their changes diffuse throughout the system. Changes, then, diffuse unpredictably –they may diffuse to small or large parts of the system or not at all, and it is this unpredictable diffusion that preserves stability in the system over time. We call our theoretical framework self-organizing criticality theory. It presents a new treatment of change and stability and improves the understanding of self-organizing.",

In these lectures we review recent attempts across several scales to understand the origins of complex biological problems from the perspective of critical phenomena. To illustrate the approach three cases are discussed, namely the large scale brain dynamics, the characterisation of spontaneous fluctuations of proteins and the physiological complexity of the cell mitochondria network.",

Here, we used a strength-dependent perturbative framework to provide a causal mechanistic description of how human brain function is perched at the delicate balance between fluctuation and oscillation. Applying local strength-dependent perturbations and subsequently measuring the perturbative complexity index clearly demonstrates that the overall balance of brain dynamics is shifted towards fluctuations for providing much needed flexibility. Importantly, stimulation in the fluctuation regime modulates specific resting state network, thus providing a mechanistic explanation of experimentally reported brain dynamics. Furthermore, this framework generates specific, testable empirical predictions for human stimulation studies using strength-dependent rather than constant perturbation. Overall, the strength-dependent perturbative framework demonstrates how the human brain is poised on the edge of criticality, between fluctuations to oscillations, allowing for maximal flexibility.",

      "abstractNote": "This study compared the effectiveness of two proprioceptive exercise programs for persons diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Thirty-three patients with mild to moderate PD were randomly assigned to a yoga meditation program (YoMed) or to an established proprioceptive training program (PRO). Both interventions included twice weekly sessions (45 minutes each), spanning a 12-week period. Outcome measures included: joint position sense (JPS\n              45\n              °, JPS\n              55\n              °, JPS\n              65\n              °) and joint kinesthesia (JK\n              Flex\n              and JK\n              Ext\n              ), the Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool (TIN), Falls Efficacy Scale (FES), Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), dynamic posturography (DMA and TIME) and the Timed Up-and-Go Test (TUG). Test administrators were blinded to group affiliation. Significant between-group differences favoring the YoMed group were observed for TIN ( p = 0.01, d = 0.77) and JK\n              Flex\n              ( p = 0.05, d = −0.72). DMA and TIME scores significantly improved for both groups, and no adverse events were reported. These findings indicate that the YoMed program is safe and effective for patients with PD. Researchers should continue to examine the clinical efficacy of mind-body techniques to improve movement control and body awareness in this population.",

      "abstractNote": "In this article we reconsider the relation between time and agency that is at the heart of the current distinction between online and offline cognition. Mainstream psychology starts out with an abstract notion of time, in which only the current moment is real. Therefore persisting representations are necessary for agents to make their way across time. We take Gibson and Heidegger to offer a different account of the relation between time and agency. Their theories suggest that, by taking agents in their world as coordinated motion, the need for representations disappears. We extend this picture of human involvement by showing how this can account for the concept of time by retaining its relational, situated structure. Finally, we return to the distinction between onand offline cognition and show that offline cognition need not be considered a different type of cognition, but only a different mode of coordinating: offline cognition in such a view is not a return to the internal manipulation of content; rather, it is a contentless, unstable mode of coordinating to the world in which the relational constitution of agency falters.",

This reconceptualization of affordances asks for a reconsideration of the ecological approach to agency. After a portrayal of the role of agency in ecological psychology, we draw upon phenomenology to reveal what it means for an agent to be invited by affordances. We sketch a dynamical model of the animal-environment relationship that aims to do justice to this analysis. In the model, agency is conceptualized as the capacity to modulate the coupling strength with the environmentdthe agent can inﬂuence to what extent he or she is inﬂuenced by the different invitations. This account of agency keeps us far from the Cartesian idea that the agent imposes behavior. Indeed, by modulating the coupling strength, the agent simply alters the dynamics of the animal-environment interactions and thus the behavior that emerges.",

At each step along the way, the evidence suggests that a cognitive process observed at one spatiotemporal scale of analysis is inseparable from the larger subsuming cognitive process observed at the next larger spatiotemporal scale of analysis. Each incremental expansion of the spatiotemporal scale of analysis is a small enough step to seem trivial, and unlikely to serve as a categorical distinction between ‘‘the mind’’ and the ‘‘rest of the world’’. Such expansions illustrate the necessity for attending to cognitive phenomena that span across two or more spatiotemporal scales. Our analysis suggests that a mind can be observed among the physical processes that connect together a brain, a body, and an environment, and even among the physical processes that connect a group of people together.",

In this article, we provide quantitative support for such a theory of interaction-dominant dynamics in human cognition by using wavelet-based multifractal analysis and accompanying multiplicative cascading process on the response series of 4 different cognitive tasks: simple response, word naming, choice decision, and interval estimation. Results indicated that the major portion of these response series had multiplicative interactions between temporal scales, visible as intermittent periods of large and irregular fluctuations (i.e., a multifractal structure). Comparing 2 component-dominant models of 1/f ␣ fluctuations in cognitive performance with the multiplicative cascading process indicated that the multifractal structure could not be replicated by these component-dominant models. Furthermore, a similar multifractal structure was shown to be present in a model of self-organized criticality in the human nervous system, similar to a spatial extension of the multiplicative cascading process. These results illustrate that a wavelet-based multifractal analysis and the multiplicative cascading process form an appropriate framework to characterize interaction-dominant dynamics in human cognition. This new framework goes beyond the identification of 1/f ␣ power laws and non-Gaussian distributions in response series as used in previous studies. The present article provides quantitative support for a paradigm shift toward interaction-dominant dynamics in human cognition.",

      "abstractNote": "Outside the laboratory, human movement typically involves redundant effector systems. How the nervous system selects among the task-equivalent solutions may provide insights into how movement is controlled. We propose a process model of movement generation that accounts for the kinematics of goal-directed pointing movements performed with a redundant arm. The key element is a neuronal dynamics that generates a virtual joint trajectory. This dynamics receives input from a neuronal timer that paces end-effector motion along its path. Within this dynamics, virtual joint velocity vectors that move the end effector are dynamically decoupled from velocity vectors that do not. Moreover, the sensed real joint configuration is coupled back into this neuronal dynamics, updating the virtual trajectory so that it yields to task-equivalent deviations from the dynamic movement plan. Experimental data from participants who perform in the same task setting as the model are compared in detail to the model predictions. We discover that joint velocities contain a substantial amount of self-motion that does not move the end effector. This is caused by the low impedance of muscle joint systems and by coupling among muscle joint systems due to multiarticulatory muscles. Back-coupling amplifies the induced control errors. We establish a link between the amount of self-motion and how curved the end-effector path is. We show that models in which an inverse dynamics cancels interaction torques predict too little selfmotion and too straight end-effector paths.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper, we set out to develop a theoretical and conceptual framework for the new ﬁeld of Radical Embodied Cognitive Neuroscience. This framework should be able to integrate insights from several relevant disciplines: theory on embodied cognition, ecological psychology, phenomenology, dynamical systems theory, and neurodynamics. We suggest that the main task of Radical Embodied Cognitive Neuroscience is to investigate the phenomenon of skilled intentionality from the perspective of the self-organization of the brain-body-environment system, while doing justice to the phenomenology of skilled action. In previous work, we have characterized skilled intentionality as the organism’s tendency toward an optimal grip on multiple relevant affordances simultaneously. Affordances are possibilities for action provided by the environment. In the ﬁrst part of this paper, we introduce the notion of skilled intentionality and the phenomenon of responsiveness to a ﬁeld of relevant affordances. Second, we use Friston’s work on neurodynamics, but embed a very minimal version of his Free Energy Principle in the ecological niche of the animal. Thus amended, this principle is helpful for understanding the embeddedness of neurodynamics within the dynamics of the system “brain-body-landscape of affordances.” Next, we show how we can use this adjusted principle to understand the neurodynamics of selective openness to the environment: interacting action-readiness patterns at multiple timescales contribute to the organism’s selective openness to relevant affordances. In the ﬁnal part of the paper, we emphasize the important role of metastable dynamics in both the brain and the brain-body-environment system for adequate affordance-responsiveness. We exemplify our integrative approach by presenting research on the impact of Deep Brain Stimulation on affordance responsiveness of OCD patients.",

      "abstractNote": "In this article, we investigate the foundations for a Gibsonian neuroscience. There is an increasingly influential current in neuroscience based on pragmatic and selectionist principles, which we think can contribute to ecological psychology. Starting from ecological psychology, we identify three basic constraints any Gibsonian neuroscience needs to adhere to: nonreconstructive perception, vicarious functioning, and selectionist self-organization. We discuss two previous attempts to integrate affordances with neuroscience: Reed’s ecological rendering of Edelman’s selectionism as well as Dreyfus’ phenomenological interpretation of Freeman’s neurodynamics. Reed and Dreyfus face the problem of how to account for “value.” We then show how the freeenergy principle, an increasingly dominant framework in theoretical neuroscience, is rooted in both Freeman’s neurodynamics and Edelman’s selectionism. The free-energy principle accounts for value in terms of selective anticipation. The selection pressures at work on the agent shape its selective sensitivity to the relevant affordances in the environment. By being responsive to the relevant affordances in the environment, an agent comes to have grip on its interactions with the environment and can thrive in its ecological niche.",

      "abstractNote": "In cognitive science, long-term anticipation, such as when planning to do something next year, is typically seen as a form of ‘higher’ cognition, requiring a different account than the more basic activities that can be understood in terms of responsiveness to ‘affordances,’ i.e. to possibilities for action. Starting from architects that anticipate the possibility to make an architectural installation over the course of many months, in this paper we develop a process-based account of affordances that includes long-term anticipation within its scope. We present a framework in which situations and their affordances unfold, and can be thought of as continuing a history of practices into a current situational activity. In this activity affordances invite skilled participants to act further. Via these invitations one situation develops into the other; an unfolding process that sets up the conditions for its own continuation. Central to our process account of affordances is the idea that engaged individuals can be responsive to the direction of the process to which their actions contribute. Anticipation, at any temporal scale, is then part and parcel of keeping attuned to the movement of the unfolding situations to which an individual contributes. We concretize our account by returning to the example of anticipation observed in architectural practice. This account of anticipation opens the door to considering a wide array of human activities traditionally characterized as ‘higher’ cognition in terms of engaging with affordances.",

Too many humanists may be unaware of the large volume of legitimate work that exists in the literature apart from Fredrickson & Losada’s (2005) paper. Often,, such legitimate lines of research are ignored, not for lack of scientific merit, but because of artificial guild boundaries and similar silos that separate groups of scientists—even when working in similar areas. It would be unfortunate to have one “bad apple” of an article spoil the reputation of the good scientific progress that has been made over the past couple of decades applying nonlinear dynamical systems theory to humanistic concepts. The present article is intended to help prevent and correct some of these problems, by providing an accesible review of some of this higher quality work.",

      "abstractNote": "Theory and methodology from nonlinear dynamical systems (NDS) may provide considerable advantage to health scientists as well as health care professionals. For instance, NDS methodologies and topics in health care share a focus upon the potentially complex interactions of biological, psychological and social factors over time. Nevertheless, a number of challenges remain in creating the necessary bridges in understanding to allow researchers to apply NDS techniques and to enable practitioners to use the resulting evidence to improve patient care. This article aims to provide such a bridge. First, common concepts pertaining to self-organizing complex adaptive systems are outlined as a general approach to understanding resilience across biological, psychological, and social scales. Next, four data analytic techniques from NDS are compared and contrasted with respect to the information they may provide about some common processes underlying resilience. These techniques are: time-series analysis, state-space grids, catastrophe modeling, and network modeling. Implications for health scientists and practitioners are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "I argue that the evolution of our life history, with its distinctively long, protected human childhood, allows an early period of broad hypothesis search and exploration, before the demands of goal-directed exploitation set in. This cognitive profile is also found in other animals and is associated with early behaviours such as neophilia and play. I relate this developmental pattern to computational ideas about explore–exploit trade-offs, search and sampling, and to neuroscience findings. I also present several lines of empirical evidence suggesting that young human learners are highly exploratory, both in terms of their search for external information and their search through hypothesis spaces. In fact, they are sometimes more exploratory than older learners and adults.\n            This article is part of the theme issue ‘Life history and learning: how childhood, caregiving and old age shape cognition and culture in humans and other animals’.",

      "abstractNote": "The aim of this paper is to explore a different, more relational worldview of skill, learning and education in sport. To do this, we turn to the work of social anthropologist, Tim Ingold, leaning on the notion of enskilment, which proposes that learning is inseparable from doing and place. From this worldview, what is learned is not an established body of knowledge, transmitted into the mind of a passive recipient from an authorised being, but is a progressively deepening embodied-embedded attentiveness, where an individual learns to self-regulate by becoming more responsive to people and environmental features by ‘looking, listening and feeling’. As we discuss, Ingold’s perspectives on enskilment are rooted in the etymological connotations of education—ex-ducere, which roughly means ‘to lead out’. In applying this notion to sport, we unpack three of its entangled components, taskscapes, guided attention, and wayfinding, detailing the implications of each for the growth of enskilled sports performers. To promote the translation of these ideas, in addition to encouraging their inquiry beyond the scope of what is discussed here, sporting examples are threaded throughout the paper.",

      "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              The smooth integration of the natural sciences with everyday lived experience is an important ambition of radical embodied cognitive science. In this paper we start from Koffka’s recommendation in his\n              Principles of Gestalt Psychology\n              that to realize this ambition psychology should be a “science of molar behaviour”. Molar behavior refers to the purposeful behaviour of the whole organism directed at an environment that is meaningfully structured for the animal. Koffka made a sharp distinction between the “behavioural environment” and the “geographical environment”. We show how this distinction picks out the difference between the environment as perceived by an individual organism, and the shared publicly available environment. The ecological psychologist James Gibson was later critical of Koffka for inserting a private phenomenal reality in between animals and the shared environment. Gibson tried to make do with just the concept of affordances in his explanation of molar behaviour. We argue however that psychology as a science of molar behaviour will need to make appeal both to the concepts of shared publicly available affordances, and of the multiplicity of\n              relevant\n              affordances that invite an individual to act. A version of Koffka’s distinction between the two environments remains alive today in a distinction we have made between the field and landscape of affordances. Having distinguished the two environments, we go on to provide an account of how the two environments are related. Koffka suggested that the behavioural environment forms out of the causal interaction of the individual with a pre-existing, ready-made geographical environment. We argue that such an account of the relation between the two environments fails to do justice to the complex entanglement of the social with the material aspects of the geographical environment. To better account for this sociomaterial reality of the geographical environment, we propose a process-perspective on our distinction between the landscape and field of affordances. While the two environments can be conceptually distinguished, we argue they should also be viewed as standing in a relation of reciprocal and mutual dependence.",

      "abstractNote": "In everyday situations, and particularly in some sport and working contexts, humans face an inherently unpredictable and uncertain environment. All sorts of unpredictable and unexpected things happen but typically people are able to skillfully adapt. In this paper, we address two key questions in cognitive science. First, how is an agent able to bring its previously learned skill to bear on a novel situation? Second, how can an agent be both sensitive to the particularity of a given situation, while remaining flexibly poised for many other possibilities for action? We will argue that both the sensitivity to novel situations and the sensitivity to a multiplicity of action possibilities are enabled by the property of skilled agency that we will call metastable attunement. We characterize a skilled agent’s flexible interactions with a dynamically changing environment in terms of metastable dynamics in agent-environment systems. What we find in metastability is the realization of two competing tendencies: the tendency of the agent to express their intrinsic dynamics and the tendency to search for new possibilities. Metastably attuned agents are ready to engage with a multiplicity of affordances, allowing for a balance between stability and flexibility. On the one hand, agents are able to exploit affordances they are attuned to, while at the same time being ready to flexibly explore for other affordances. Metastable attunement allows agents to smoothly transition between these possible configurations so as to adapt their behaviour to what the particular situation requires. We go on to describe the role metastability plays in learning of new skills, and in skilful behaviour more generally. Finally, drawing upon work in art, architecture and sports science, we develop a number of perspectives on how to investigate metastable attunement in real life situations.",

      "abstractNote": "Biological agents can act in ways that express a sensitivity to context-dependent relevance. So far it has proven difficult to engineer this capacity for context-dependent sensitivity to relevance in artificial agents. We give this problem the label the “problem of meaning”. The problem of meaning could be circumvented if artificial intelligence researchers were to design agents based on the assumption of the continuity of life and mind. In this paper, we focus on the proposal made by enactive cognitive scientists to design artificial agents that possess sensorimotor autonomy—stable, self-sustaining patterns of sensorimotor interaction that can ground values, norms and goals necessary for encountering a meaningful environment. More specifically, we consider whether the Free Energy Principle (FEP) can provide formal tools for modeling sensorimotor autonomy. There is currently no consensus on how to understand the relationship between enactive cognitive science and the FEP. However, a number of recent papers have argued that the two frameworks are fundamentally incompatible. Some argue that biological systems exhibit historical path-dependent learning that is absent from systems that minimize free energy. Others have argued that a free energy minimizing system would fail to satisfy a key condition for sensorimotor agency referred to as “interactional asymmetry”. These critics question the claim we defend in this paper that the FEP can be used to formally model autonomy and adaptivity. We will argue it is too soon to conclude that the two frameworks are incompatible. There are undeniable conceptual differences between the two frameworks but in our view each has something important and necessary to offer. The FEP needs enactive cognitive science for the solution it provides to the problem of meaning. Enactive cognitive science needs the FEP to formally model the properties it argues to be constitutive of agency. Our conclusion will be that active inference models based on the FEP provides a way by which scientists can think about how to address the problems of engineering autonomy and adaptivity in artificial agents in formal terms. In the end engaging more closely with this formalism and its further developments will benefit those working within the enactive framework.",

      "abstractNote": "Social coordination and affordance perception always take part in concrete situations in real life. Nonetheless, the different ﬁelds of ecological psychology studying these phenomena do not seem to make this situated nature an object of study. To integrate both ﬁelds and extend the reach of the ecological approach, we introduce the Skilled Intentionality Framework that situates both social coordination and affordance perception within the human form of life and its rich landscape of affordances. We argue that in the human form of life the social and the material are intertwined and best understood as sociomateriality. Taking the form of life as our starting point foregrounds sociomateriality in each perspective we take on engaging with affordances. Using ethnographical examples we show how sociomateriality shows up from three different perspectives we take on affordances in a real-life situation. One perspective shows us a landscape of affordances that the sociomaterial environment offers. Zooming in on this landscape to the perspective of a local observer, we can focus on an individual coordinating with affordances offered by things and other people situated in this landscape. Finally, viewed from within this unfolding activity, we arrive at the person’s lived perspective: a ﬁeld of relevant affordances solicits activity. The Skilled Intentionality Framework offers a way of integrating social coordination and affordance theory by drawing attention to these complementary perspectives. We end by showing a reallife example from the practice of architecture that suggests how this situated view that foregrounds sociomateriality can extend the scope of ecological psychology to forms of so-called “higher” cognition.",

The chapter is organized as follows. It first addresses why models aimed at reducing behavior to cognitive components cannot make clear headway. The argument is that a reduction of behavior requires human performance to be relatively context free. However, it is shown with the example of balance task performance that human performance is highly context dependent, even in the sterile laboratory context of balance experiments. The chapter then elaborates on what such context dependence could mean. The chapter reviews more pointed evidence for soft assembly and discusses why models that take soft assembly seriously—connectionist or dynamic systems—anticipate the unified theory.",

In this article, an overview is first provided of the Complex Systems Conceptual Framework for Learning (CSCFL), which consists of a set of conceptual perspectives that are generally shared by educational complex systems organized into two focus areas: collective behaviors of a system and behaviors of individual agents in a system. Complexity and research methodologies for education are then considered, and it is observed that commonly used quantitative and qualitative techniques are generally appropriate for studying linear dynamics of educational systems. However, it is proposed that computational modeling approaches being extensively used for studying nonlinear characteristics of complex systems in other fields can provide a methodological complement to quantitative and qualitative educational research approaches. Two research case studies of this approach are discussed. We conclude with a consideration of how viewing education as a complex system using complex systems conceptual and methodological tools that can help advance educational research and also inform policy.",

      "abstractNote": "This article concentrates on the question what kind of model - conceptual and statistical - can serve as a good working model for the study of learning and teaching processes qua processes. We claim that a good way of answering this question is to begin by observing a teaching and learning process as, where, and when it occurs. In addition, a conceptual model of intertwined learning-teaching processes is discussed, and dynamic modeling as an approach to theory formation about teaching-learning processes. The focus lies on the evolution term, the timescale of interaction processes, state space as a perspective on teacher-student interaction dynamics, and the principle of agency. Finally, an empirical approach to studying teaching-learning processes is illustrated by means of a case study, focusing on the use of cluster analyses techniques. In the Conclusion and Discussion section, further perspectives on theory building and empirical research are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Significance\n            The size of scientific fields may impede the rise of new ideas. Examining 1.8 billion citations among 90 million papers across 241 subjects, we find a deluge of papers does not lead to turnover of central ideas in a field, but rather to ossification of canon. Scholars in fields where many papers are published annually face difficulty getting published, read, and cited unless their work references already widely cited articles. New papers containing potentially important contributions cannot garner field-wide attention through gradual processes of diffusion. These findings suggest fundamental progress may be stymied if quantitative growth of scientific endeavors—in number of scientists, institutes, and papers—is not balanced by structures fostering disruptive scholarship and focusing attention on novel ideas.\n          , \n            In many academic fields, the number of papers published each year has increased significantly over time. Policy measures aim to increase the quantity of scientists, research funding, and scientific output, which is measured by the number of papers produced. These quantitative metrics determine the career trajectories of scholars and evaluations of academic departments, institutions, and nations. Whether and how these increases in the numbers of scientists and papers translate into advances in knowledge is unclear, however. Here, we first lay out a theoretical argument for why too many papers published each year in a field can lead to stagnation rather than advance. The deluge of new papers may deprive reviewers and readers the cognitive slack required to fully recognize and understand novel ideas. Competition among many new ideas may prevent the gradual accumulation of focused attention on a promising new idea. Then, we show data supporting the predictions of this theory. When the number of papers published per year in a scientific field grows large, citations flow disproportionately to already well-cited papers; the list of most-cited papers ossifies; new papers are unlikely to ever become highly cited, and when they do, it is not through a gradual, cumulative process of attention gathering; and newly published papers become unlikely to disrupt existing work. These findings suggest that the progress of large scientific fields may be slowed, trapped in existing canon. Policy measures shifting how scientific work is produced, disseminated, consumed, and rewarded may be called for to push fields into new, more fertile areas of study.",

      "abstractNote": "We investigated the differences in brain fMRI signal complexity in patients with schizophrenia while performing the Cyberball social exclusion task, using measures of Sample entropy and Hurst exponent (H). 13 patients meeting diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM IV) criteria for schizophrenia and 16 healthy controls underwent fMRI scanning at 1.5 T. The fMRI data of both groups of participants were pre-processed, the entropy characterized and the Hurst exponent extracted. Whole brain entropy and H maps of the groups were generated and analysed. The results after adjusting for age and sex differences together show that patients with schizophrenia exhibited higher complexity than healthy controls, at mean whole brain and regional levels. Also, both Sample entropy and Hurst exponent agree that patients with schizophrenia have more complex fMRI signals than healthy controls. These results suggest that schizophrenia is associated with more complex signal patterns when compared to healthy controls, supporting the increase in complexity hypothesis, where system complexity increases with age or disease, and also consistent with the notion that schizophrenia is characterised by a dysregulation of the nonlinear dynamics of underlying neuronal systems.",

      "abstractNote": "Much of our enjoyment of music comes from its balance of predictability and surprise. Musical pitch fluctuations follow a 1/\n              f\n              power law that precisely achieves this balance. Musical rhythms, especially those of Western classical music, are considered highly regular and predictable, and this predictability has been hypothesized to underlie rhythm's contribution to our enjoyment of music. Are musical rhythms indeed entirely predictable and how do they vary with genre and composer? To answer this question, we analyzed the rhythm spectra of 1,788 movements from 558 compositions of Western classical music. We found that an overwhelming majority of rhythms obeyed a 1/\n              f\n              β\n              power law across 16 subgenres and 40 composers, with β ranging from ∼0.5–1. Notably, classical composers, whose compositions are known to exhibit nearly identical 1/\n              f\n              pitch spectra, demonstrated distinctive 1/\n              f\n              rhythm spectra: Beethoven's rhythms were among the most predictable, and Mozart's among the least. Our finding of the ubiquity of 1/\n              f\n              rhythm spectra in compositions spanning nearly four centuries demonstrates that, as with musical pitch, musical rhythms also exhibit a balance of predictability and surprise that could contribute in a fundamental way to our aesthetic experience of music. Although music compositions are intended to be performed, the fact that the notated rhythms follow a 1/\n              f\n              spectrum indicates that such structure is no mere artifact of performance or perception, but rather, exists within the written composition before the music is performed. Furthermore, composers systematically manipulate (consciously or otherwise) the predictability in 1/\n              f\n              rhythms to give their compositions unique identities.",

      "abstractNote": "The analysis of structural patterns in music is of interest in order to increase our fundamental understanding of music, as well as for devising algorithms for computer-generated music, so called algorithmic composition. Musical melodies can be analyzed in terms of a “music walk” between the pitches of successive tones in a notescript, in analogy with the “random walk” model commonly used in physics. We ﬁnd that the distribution of melodic intervals between tones can be approximated with a L´evy-stable distribution. Since music also exibits self-aﬃne scaling, we propose that the “music walk” should be modelled as a L´evy motion. We ﬁnd that the L´evy motion model captures basic structural patterns in classical as well as in folk music.",

      "abstractNote": "Heart rate variability has been analyzed conventionally with time and frequency domain methods, which measure the overall magnitude of RR interval fluctuations around its mean value or the magnitude of fluctuations in some predetermined frequencies. Analysis of heart rate dynamics by methods based on chaos theory and nonlinear system theory has gained recent interest. This interest is based on observations suggesting that the mechanisms involved in cardiovascular regulation likely interact with each other in a nonlinear way. Furthermore, recent observational studies suggest that some indexes describing nonlinear heart rate dynamics, such as fractal scaling exponents, may provide more powerful prognostic information than the traditional heart rate variability indexes. In particular, the short-term fractal scaling exponent measured by the detrended fluctuation analysis method has predicted fatal cardiovascular events in various populations. Approximate entropy, a nonlinear index of heart rate dynamics, that describes the complexity of RR interval behavior, has provided information on the vulnerability to atrial fibrillation. Many other nonlinear indexes, e.g., Lyapunov exponent and correlation dimensions, also give information on the characteristics of heart rate dynamics, but their clinical utility is not well established. Although concepts of chaos theory, fractal mathematics, and complexity measures of heart rate behavior in relation to cardiovascular physiology or various cardiovascular events are still far away from clinical medicine, they are a fruitful area for future research to expand our knowledge concerning the behavior of cardiovascular oscillations in normal healthy conditions as well as in disease states.",

      "abstractNote": "Children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) struggle to perform a host of daily activities. Many of these involve forceful interaction with objects and thus implicate dynamic touch. Therefore, deficits in dynamic touch could underlie functional difficulties presented by ADHD children. We investigated whether performance on a dynamic touch task (length perception by wielding) differ between children with ADHD and age-matched controls. We further examined whether this difference could be explained by fractal temporal correlations (wielding dynamics). Forty-two children (ADHD: 21; typically developing: 21) wielded unseen wooden rods and reported their perceived length in the form of magnitude productions. The rods varied in the magnitude of the first principal moment of inertia (I1). Three-dimensional displacements of hand and rod positions were submitted to Detrended Fluctuation Analysis to estimate trial-by-trial temporal correlations. Children with ADHD reported shorter length for rods with higher I1 than their typically developing peers, indicative of reduced sensitivity to mechanical information supporting dynamic touch. Importantly, temporal correlations in wielding dynamics moderated children’s usage of I1. This finding points to a role of exploratory movements in perceptual deficits presented by children with ADHD and, thus, should be considered a new potential target for interventions.",

      "abstractNote": "Intermittent fasting ( IF; reduced meal frequency) and caloric restriction (CR) extend lifespan and increase resistance to age-related diseases in rodents and monkeys and improve the health of overweight humans. Both IF and CR enhance cardiovascular and brain functions and improve several risk factors for coronary artery disease and stroke including a reduction in blood pressure and increased insulin sensitivity. Cardiovascular stress adaptation is improved and heart rate variability is increased in rodents maintained on an IF or a CR diet. Moreover, rodents maintained on an IF regimen exhibit increased resistance of heart and brain cells to ischemic injury in experimental models of myocardial infarction and stroke. The beneficial effects of IF and CR result from at least two mechanisms —reduced oxidative damage and increased cellular stress resistance. Recent findings suggest that some of the beneficial effects of IF on both the cardiovascular system and the brain are mediated by brain- derived neurotrophic factor signaling in the brain. Interestingly, cellular and molecular effects of IF and CR on the cardiovascular system and the brain are similar to those of regular physical exercise, suggesting shared mechanisms. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which IF and CR affect the blood vessels and heart and brain cells will likely lead to novel preventative and therapeutic strategies for extending health span.",

      "abstractNote": "Evidence for a close bidirectional link between the brain and the gut has led to a paradigm shift in neurology, especially in the case of Parkinson disease (PD), in which gastrointestinal dysfunction is a prominent feature. Over the past decade, numerous high-q uality preclinical and clinical publications have shed light on the highly complex relationship between the gut and the brain in PD, providing potential for the development of new biomarkers and therapeutics. With the advent of high-t hroughput sequencing, the role of the gut microbiome has been specifically highlighted. Here, we provide a critical review of the literature on the microbiome–gut–brain axis in PD and present perspectives that will be useful for clinical practice. We begin with an overview of the gut–brain axis in PD, including the potential roles and interrelationships of the vagus nerve, α-s ynuclein in the enteric nervous system, altered intestinal permeability and inflammation, and gut microbes and their metabolic activities. The sections that follow synthesize the proposed roles of gut-r elated factors in the development and progression of, in responses to PD treatment, and as therapeutic targets. Finally, we summarize current knowledge gaps and challenges and delineate future directions for the field.",

      "abstractNote": "Undesirable and desirable effects of stressors on the body are assigned to distress and eustress, respectively. Immune system and brain are the most susceptible parts to stressful conditions, whereas longlasting alterations in putative immune proteins involved in tension such as corticosterone (CORT), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) can impact learning and memory. Intermittent fasting (IF) is a repeated regular cycle of dietary restriction with well-known beneﬁcial properties on the body. The aim of this study was to identify the eustress effects of IF on cognitive function by assessing the critical inﬂammatory factors in chronic distress. Forty male mice were divided into four groups (n = 10/group). Distress and control normally received food and water, whereas IF and IF with distress groups were daily deprived of food and water for two hours. In the second week, the electrical foot shock was induced to distress and IF with distress groups. Finally, the cognitive functions of all mice were evaluated by Barnes maze, their blood samples were taken to determine the plasma level of CORT, IL-6 and TNF-a, and the removed brain and adrenal glands were weighed in the third week. A signiﬁcant gain in plasma level of CORT, IL-6 and TNF-a with a considerable brain hypotrophy and adrenal hypertrophy was found in distress group, whereas IF caused a remarkable reduction of the plasma inﬂammatory factors, especially in IF with distress mice (P 0.05). In conclusion, IF could improve cognitive function and preserve the brain against distress by regulation of inﬂammatory response pathway.",

      "abstractNote": "Interoception, defined as the sense of the internal bodily state, plays a critical role in physical, cognitive, emotional and social well-being. Regarding physical well-being, contemporary models of exercise regulation incorporate interoceptive processes in the regulation of physical exertion. Top-down processes continuously monitor the physiological condition of the body to ensure allostasis is maintained, however, flagged perturba­ tions also appear to influence these higher order processes in return. More specifically, enhancing one's physi­ ological arousal by means of physical activity is a viable way of manipulating the afferent input entering the interoceptive system, appearing to optimise the integration of early sensory stimulation with later affective re­ sponses. Despite this, the relationship between physical activity and top-down regulation is underrepresented in interoceptive research. We here address this gap by integrating findings from different disciplines to support the overlapping mechanisms, with the hope of stimulating further research in this field. Developing our under­ standing of how interoceptive processes are shaped by physical activity could hold significant clinical implica­ tions considering the impact of interoceptive deficits to mental health and well-being.",

      "abstractNote": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the adult population is frequently associated with comorbid psychiatric diseases that complicate its recognition, diagnosis and management. The prevalence of ADHD in the general adult population is 2.5% and it is associated with substantial personal and individual burden. The most frequent comorbid psychopathologies include mood and anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and personality disorders. There are strong familial links and neurobiological similarities between ADHD and the various associated psychiatric comorbidities. The overlapping symptoms between ADHD and comorbid psychopathologies represent challenges for diagnosis and treatment. Guidelines recommend that when ADHD coexists with other psychopathologies in adults, the most impairing condition should generally be treated first. Early recognition and treatment of ADHD and its comorbidities has the potential to change the trajectory of psychiatric morbidity later in life. The use of validated assessment scales and high-yield clinical questions can help identify adults with ADHD who could potentially benefit from evidence-based management strategies.",

Although both the low- and the high-variance groups produced data that displayed the trends typical of mental rotation, the two groups’ reaction time sequences had very different autocorrelation functions. Power spectra derived from the two groups’ data showed the presence of distinctive noise processes with long memory. Normal levels of variance were associated with 1/f noise, whereas high-variance data had substantial traces of random walk contour.

Research has indicated that individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder actually may give elite athletes a slight edge because of symptoms such as preservation or hyperfocus. Exercise is a plausible treatment for behavioral symptoms and cognitive performance of persons with ADHD. Athletes with ADHD exhibit increased risk-taking behavior, and this is hypothesized to lead to an increased risk of sports injury. As with social skills training, participation in sports improves social deficits and also elevates mood and motivation level. Children and adults who have recently been diagnosed with this condition need to learn social cues and how to trust peers, adhere to rules, and effectively participate in structured activities.",

      "abstractNote": "Anhedonia, defined as the state of reduced ability to experience feelings of pleasure, is one of the hallmarks of depression. Hedonic tone is the trait underlying one’s characteristic ability to feel pleasure. Low hedonic tone represents a reduced capacity to experience pleasure, thus increasing the likelihood of experiencing anhedonia. Low hedonic tone has been associated with several psychopathologies, including major depressive disorder (MDD), substance use, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The main neural pathway that modulates emotional affect comprises the limbic–cortical–striatal–pallidal–thalamic circuits. The activity of various components of the limbic–cortical–striatal–pallidal–thalamic pathway is correlated with hedonic tone in healthy individuals and is altered in MDD. Dysfunction of these circuits has also been implicated in the relative ineffectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors used to treat anxiety and depression in patients with low hedonic tone. Mood disorders such as MDD, ADHD, and substance abuse share low hedonic tone as well as altered activation of brain regions involved in reward processing and monoamine signaling as their features. Given the common features of these disorders, it is not surprising that they have high levels of comorbidities. The purpose of this article is to review the neurobiology of hedonic tone as it pertains to depression, ADHD, and the potential for substance abuse. We propose that, since low hedonic tone is a shared feature of MDD, ADHD, and substance abuse, evaluation of hedonic tone may become a diagnostic feature used to predict subtypes of MDD, such as treatment-resistant depression, as well as comorbidities of these disorders.",

Because depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are frequently comorbid and share a complex relationship, we hypothesized that ADHD may be a predictive factor for the diagnosis of TRD. This exploratory study aimed to determine the percentage of undetected ADHD in those with TRD and evaluate factors associated with treatment resistance and undetected ADHD in depressed patients. Subjects and methods: Adults referred (n=160) for psychiatric consultation completed a structured interview (MINI Plus, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus) to assess the presence of psychiatric disorders.\nResults: TRD was significantly associated with the number of diagnoses (P,0.001), past (P,0.001) and present medications (P,0.001), chronic anhedonia (P=0.013), and suicide ideation (P=0.008). Undetected ADHD was present in 34% of TRD patients. The number of referral diagnoses (P,0.001), failed medications (P=0.002), and past selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor failures (P=0.035) were predictive of undetected ADHD in TRD.\nConclusion: Undetected ADHD may be more prevalent among TRD patients than previously thought. In addition, TRD patients are more likely to present with psychiatric comorbidity than non-TRD patients. Screening patients with depression for the presence of ADHD and chronic anhedonia/low hedonic tone may help identify patients with TRD and undetected ADHD and improve treatment outcomes.",

TD had more connected, larger subcortical structures in regions associated with implicit memory.\nConclusions: It was found that the memory systems within brains of children with exceptional intellectual abilities are differently sized and connected compared to the brains of typically developing children. These different neurodevelopmental trajectories suggest different learning strategies. A spectrum of intelligence types is envisioned, facilitated by different ratios of implicit and explicit system, which was validated using a large external dataset.",

Novel psychophysiological measures may enhance the data that is derived from CPTs and thereby improve clinical decision-making regarding diagnosis and treatment. As part of the current study, we integrated an eye tracker with the MOXO-dCPT and assessed the utility of eye movement measures to differentiate ADHD patients and healthy controls.\n            \n            \n              Method:\n              Adult ADHD patients and gender/age-matched healthy controls performed the MOXO-dCPT while their eye movements were monitored ( n = 33 per group).\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              ADHD patients spent significantly more time gazing at irrelevant regions, both on the screen and outside of it, than healthy controls. The eye movement measures showed adequate ability to classify ADHD patients. Moreover, a scale that combined eye movement measures enhanced group prediction, compared to the sole use of conventional MOXO-dCPT indices.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions:\n              Integrating an eye tracker with CPTs is a feasible way of enhancing diagnostic precision and shows initial promise for clarifying the cognitive profile of ADHD patients.

Twenty-four DCD children without ADHD aged eight to thirteen and 60 control children were asked (1) to perform a Continuous Performance Test assessing sustained attention; (2) to ﬂex one ﬁnger either in synchrony or in syncopation with a visual periodic signal whose frequency was increased stepwise, assessing synchronization abilities. For the attentional task, percentage of exact responses, number of errors and reaction time were recorded. For the synchronization task, we measured relative phase (i.e., the ratio between the stimulus and the response onset and the time separating two successive stimuli). DCD children were signiﬁcantly more variable than controls in both conditions and the difﬁculty in synchronization was unrelated to attentional disorders (ANCOVA). These ﬁndings support the idea of a general synchronization disorder in DCD children underlying their poor motor coordination. Moreover, this synchronization disorder does not appear to be strictly dependent on the level of sustained attentional capacities.",

      "abstractNote": "Many motor learning studies focus on average performance while it is known from everyday life experience that humans differ in their way of learning new motor tasks. This study emphasises the importance of recognizing individual differences in motor learning. We studied individual tool grasping profiles of individuals who learned to pick up objects with a novel tool, a pair of pliers. The pair of pliers was attached to the thumb and the index finger so that the tip of the thumb and the tip of the index finger were displaced to the beaks of the pair of pliers. The grasp component was manipulated by varying the location of the hinge of the pair of pliers, which resulted in different relations between beak opening and closing and finger opening and closing. The Wider Beak group had the hinge at 7 cm, the Same Beak group had the hinge at 10 cm (i.e., in the middle), and the Smaller Beak group had the hinge at 13 cm from the digits. Each group consisted of ten righthanded participants who picked up an object with one of the pairs of pliers 200 times on two subsequent days. Hand opening, plateau phase, hand closing, grasping time and maximum aperture were analyzed. To characterize individual changes over practice time, a log function was fitted on these dependent variables and the ratio of improvement was determined. Results showed that at the beginning stage of tool use learning the characteristic grasping profile consisted of three phases; hand opening, plateau phase and hand closing. Over practicing individual participants differed in the number of phases that changed, the amount of change in a phase and/or the direction of change. Moreover, with different pliers different learning paths were found. The importance of recognizing individual differences in motor learning is discussed.",

Two-component models of upper limb movement have not yet considered how joint angles are organized to deal with the energy constraints associated with moving the upper limb in goal-directed aiming tasks. To address this limitation, participants performed aiming movements to targets in the up and down directions with the index ﬁnger and two types of rod extensions attached to the index ﬁnger. The rod extensions were expected to invoke different energy optimizing strategies in the up and down directions by allowing the distal joints the opportunity to contribute to end effector displacement. Primary movements undershot the farthest target to a greater extent in the downward direction compared to the upward direction, showing that movement kinematics optimize energy expenditure in consideration of the effects of gravity. As rod length increased, shoulder elevation was optimized in movements to the far-up target and elbow ﬂexion was optimally minimized in movements to the far-down target. The results suggest energy optimization in the control of joint angles independent of the force of gravity.",

      "abstractNote": "To allow different views on motor learning to inform rehabilitation research, the authors aimed to explicate a frequently missed yet fundamental difference in starting point of such views. By considering how rehabilitation in practice answers the question of what parts an activity consists of, reductive and emergent approaches to motor learning are identiﬁed and traced throughout rehabilitation practice. The authors show that when a task is cut up along reductive dimensions while also apparently relying on emergent components, this unequally favors the reductive approach and acts to limit the views on motor learning available. By showing the approaches in practice, the authors hope to inspire an awareness that brings both approaches the opportunity to independently inform research so that new theories and practices can proliferate.",

      "abstractNote": "This study aims to determine to what extent the task for an action system in its initial development relies on functional and anatomical components. Fifty-two able-bodied participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups or to a control group. As a pre- and post-test all groups performed a computer game with the same goal and using the same musculature. One experimental group also trained to perform this test, while the other two experimental groups learned to perform a game that differed either in its goal or in the musculature used. The observed change in accuracy indicated that retaining the goal of the task or the musculature used equally increased transfer performance relative to controls. Conversely, changing either the goal or the musculature equally decreased transfer relative to training the test. These results suggest that in the initial development of an action system, the task to which the system pertains is not speciﬁed solely by either the goal of the task or the anatomical structures involved. It is suggested that functional speciﬁcity and anatomical dependence might equally be outcomes of continuously differentiating activity.",

      "abstractNote": "Mastering a motor skill is typified by a decrease in variability. However, variability is much more than the undesired signature of discoordination: structure in both its distributional properties and temporal sequence can reveal control priorities. Extending from the notion that signal-dependent noise corrupts information transmission in the neuromotor system, this review tracks more recent recognitions that the complex dynamic motor system in its interaction with task constraints creates high-dimensional spaces with multiple equivalent solutions. Further analysis differentiates these solutions to have different degrees of noise-sensitivity, goalrelevance or additional costs. Practice proceeds from exploration of these solution spaces to then exploitation with further channeling of noise. Extended practice leads to fine-tuning of skill brought about by reducing noise. These distinct changes in variability are suggested as a way to characterize stages of learning. Capitalizing on the sensitivity of the CNS to noise, interventions can add extrinsic or amplify intrinsic noise to guide (re-)learning desired behaviors. The persistence and generalization of acquired skill is still largely understudied, although an essential element of skill. Consistent with advances in the physical sciences, there is increasing realization that noise can have beneficial effects. Analysis of the non-random structure of variability may reveal more than analysis of only its mean.",

Because the endpoint position (i.e., the tip of the index finger) at the reaching target can be achieved with multiple joint angle combinations, we partitioned variability in joint angles over trials into variability that does not (goal-equivalent variability, GEV) and that does (non-goal-equivalent variability, NGEV) influence the endpoint position, using the Uncontrolled Manifold method. Quantifying this structure in joint angle variability allowed us to examine whether and how spatial variability of the endpoint at the reaching target is related to variability in joint angles and how this changes over development. 6-, 8- and 10-year-old children and young adults performed reaching movements to a target with the index finger. Polynomial trend analysis revealed a linear and a quadratic decreasing trend for the variable error. Linear decreasing and cubic trends were found for joint angle standard deviations at movement end. GEV and NGEV decreased gradually with age, but interestingly, the decrease of GEV was steeper than the decrease of NGEV, showing that the different parts of the joint angle variability changed differently over age. We interpreted these changes in the structure of variability as indicating changes over age in exploration for synergies (a family of task solutions), a concept that links the performance level with the joint angle level. Our results suggest changes in the search for synergies during mid-childhood development.",

      "abstractNote": "Goal‐directed actions become truly functional and skilled when they are consistent yet flexible. In manual pointing, end‐effector consistency is characterized by the end position of the index fingertip, whereas flexibility in movement execution is captured by the use of abundant arm‐joint configurations not affecting the index finger end position. Because adults have been shown to exploit their system's flexibility in challenging conditions, we wondered whether during middle childhood children are already able to exploit motor flexibility when demanded by the situation. We had children aged 5–10 years and adults perform pointing movements in a nonchallenging and challenging condition. Results showed that end‐effector errors and flexibility in movement execution decreased with age. Importantly, only the 9‐10year‐olds and adults showed increased flexibility in the challenging condition. Thus, while consistency increases and flexibility decreases during mid‐childhood development, from the age of nine children appear able to employ more flexibility with increasing task demands.",

Still, the role of high motor variability in DCD needs further examination. This study focused on variability in coordination patterns, which is essential considering that DCD is a coordination disorder. We examined variability in coordination patterns of the arm over repetitions of trials in goal-directed reaching movements. This variability was partitioned into variability that does not affect the index fingertip position (Vucm) and variability that does affect the index fingertip position (Vort). This study aimed to increase the understanding of motor variability in DCD by comparing Vucm and Vort between children with DCD and typically developing (TD) children in a goal-directed reaching task. Twenty-two children (eleven with DCD) ages 6 – 11 performed 30 reaching movements. The Uncontrolled Manifold method was used to quantify Vucm and Vort. Results showed that children with DCD had more Vucm than TD children while Vort was similar between groups, showing that coordination patterns in children with DCD are more variable, but interestingly, this higher variability does not affect performance. This study indicates that high motor variability in DCD is not necessarily negative. Possible roles of motor variability in DCD are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "The Dynamic Systems Approach (DSA) to development has been shown to be a promising theory to understand developmental changes. In this perspective, we use the example of mid-childhood (6- to 10-years of age) reaching to show how using the DSA can advance the understanding of development. Mid-childhood is an important developmental period that has often been overshadowed by the focus on the acquisition of reaching during infancy. This underrepresentation of mid-childhood studies is unjustiﬁed, as earlier studies showed that important developmental changes in mid-childhood reaching occur that reﬁne the skill of reaching. We review these studies here for the ﬁrst time and show that different studies revealed different developmental trends, such as non-monotonic and linear trends, for variables such as movement time and accuracy at target. Unfortunately, proposed explanations for these developmental changes have been tailored to individual studies, limiting their scope. Also, explanations were focused on a single component or process in the system that supposedly causes developmental changes. Here, we propose that the DSA can offer an overarching explanation for developmental changes in this research ﬁeld. According to the DSA, motor behavior emerges from interactions of multiple components entailed by the person, environment, and task. Changes in all these components can potentially contribute to the emerging behavior. We show how the principles of change of the DSA can be used as an overarching framework by applying these principles not only to development, but also the behavior itself. This underlines its applicability to other ﬁelds of development.",

      "abstractNote": "OBJECTIVES: Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with a high rate of epilepsy and subclinical epileptiform activity. High physical connectivity on a microcolumnar level leading to epileptiform activity and low functional informational connectivity are assumed in autism. The aim of this study was to investigate nonlinear EEG brain dynamics in terms of synchronization in a group of children with autism spectrum disorders compared to a control group. We expected a lower degree of synchronization in autistic subjects.\nMETHODS: The autistic group consisted of 27 patients with autism spectrum disorders diagnosed according to ICD-10. The mean age of the sample was 7.1 (SD 3.6) years, 14 of them were mentally retarded. Normal EEG was found in 9 patients, epileptiform EEG in 18 autistic patients. Four patients had a history of epileptic seizures, fully compensated in long term. The control group consisted of 20 children (mean age of 8.4, SD 2.3 years) with normal intelligence, without an epileptic history, investigated within the frame of the research program for cochlear implantation. They had normal neurological examination and suffered from perceptive deafness. Normal EEG was found in 17 of the control subjects, epileptiform EEG was in 3 control subjects. We analyzed night sleep EEG recordings from 10 channels (F3, F4, F7, F8, C3, C4, T3, T4, P3 and P4) with the inclusion of sleep stages NREM 2, 3 and 4 in the subsequent analyses. Coarse-grained entropy information rates between neighbouring electrodes were computed, expressing the synchronization between 11 selected electrode couples.\nRESULTS: Synchronization was significantly lower in the autistic group in all three examined NREM stages even when age and intelligence were taken into account as covariates.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of the study confirmed the validity of the underconnectivity model in autism.",

      "abstractNote": "Sleep beneﬁts memory consolidation. The reviewed studies indicate that this consolidating effect is not revealed under all circumstances but is linked to speciﬁc psychological conditions. Speciﬁcally, we discuss to what extent memory consolidation during sleep depends on the type of learning materials, type of learning and retrieval test, different features of sleep and the subject population. Post-learning sleep enhances consolidation of declarative, procedural and emotional memories. The enhancement is greater for weakly than strongly encoded associations and more consistent for explicitly than implicitly encoded memories. Memories associated with expected reward gain preferentially access to sleep-dependent consolidation. For declarative memories, sleep beneﬁts are more consistently revealed with recall than recognition procedures at retrieval testing. Slow wave sleep (SWS) particularly enhances declarative memories whereas rapid eye movement (REM) sleep preferentially supports procedural and emotional memory aspects. Declarative memory proﬁts already from rather short sleep periods (1–2 h). Procedural memory proﬁts seem more dose-dependent on the amount of sleep following the day after learning. Children’s sleep with high amounts of SWS distinctly enhances declarative memories whereas elderly and psychiatric patients with disturbed sleep show impaired sleep-associated consolidation often of declarative memories. Based on the constellation of psychological conditions identiﬁed we hypothesize that access to sleep-dependent consolidation requires memories to be encoded under control of prefrontalhippocampal circuitry, with the same circuitry controlling subsequent consolidation during sleep.",

      "abstractNote": "Introduction: Disruptions in sleep and circadian rhythms are observed in individuals with bipolar disorders (BD), both during acute mood episodes and remission. Such abnormalities may relate to dysfunction of the molecular circadian clock and could offer a target for new drugs. Areas covered: This review focuses on clinical, actigraphic, biochemical and genetic biomarkers of BDs, as well as animal and cellular models, and highlights that sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances are closely linked to the susceptibility to BDs and vulnerability to mood relapses. As lithium is likely to act as a synchronizer and stabilizer of circadian rhythms, we will review pharmacogenetic studies testing circadian gene polymorphisms and prophylactic response to lithium. Interventions such as sleep deprivation, light therapy and psychological therapies may also target sleep and circadian disruptions in BDs efficiently for treatment and prevention of bipolar depression. Expert opinion: We suggest that future research should clarify the associations between sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances and alterations of the molecular clock in order to identify critical targets within the circadian pathway. The investigation of such targets using human cellular models or animal models combined with ‘omics’ approaches are crucial steps for new drug development.",

      "abstractNote": "Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness characterized by alternating periods of elevated and depressed mood. Sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder are present during all stages of the condition and exert a negative impact on overall course, quality of life, and treatment outcomes. We examine the partnership between circadian system (process C) functioning and sleep–wake homeostasis (process S) on optimal sleep functioning and explore the role of disruptions in both systems on sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder. A convergence of evidence suggests that sleep problems in bipolar disorder result from dysregulation across both process C and process S systems. Biomarkers of depressive episodes include heightened fragmentation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, reduced REM latency, increased REM density, and a greater percentage of awakenings, while biomarkers of manic episodes include reduced REM latency, greater percentage of stage I sleep, increased REM density, discontinuous sleep patterns, shortened total sleep time, and a greater time awake in bed. These findings highlight the importance of targeting novel treatments for sleep disturbance in bipolar disorder.",

This review analyzes the macrostructural and microstructural sleep features, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria (PRISMA). We included the polysomnographic studies published in the last 15 years. The results of macrostructural parameters are mixed. Almost half of the 18 selected investigations did not ﬁnd diﬀerences between sleep architecture of children with ADHD and controls. Five studies observed that children with ADHD show a longer Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep duration than controls. Eight studies included microstructural measures. Remarkable alterations in sleep microstructure of ADHD are related to slow wave activity (SWA) and theta oscillations, respectively, during Non-REM (NREM) and REM sleep. Speciﬁcally, some studies found higher SWA in the ADHD group than controls. Similarly, higher theta activity appears to be detrimental for memory performance and inhibitory control in ADHD. These patterns could be interpreted as a maturational delay in ADHD. Also, the increased amount of these activities would be consistent with the hypothesis that the poor sleep could imply a chronic sleep deprivation in children with ADHD, which in turn could aﬀect their cognitive functioning.",

For most of the twentieth century, scientific dream theories were mainly psychological. Since the discovery of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the neural underpinnings of dreaming have become increasingly well understood, and it is now possible to complement the details of these brain mechanisms with a theory of consciousness that is derived from the study of dreaming. The theory advanced here emphasizes data that suggest that REM sleep may constitute a protoconscious state, providing a virtual reality model of the world that is of functional use to the development and maintenance of waking consciousness.",

      "abstractNote": "Background: Athletic performance without beneﬁt from performance-enhancing substances is essential in amateur sports; yet, prohibiting speciﬁc medications creates discrimination against competitors with a medical illness. To avoid such inequalities, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) adopted international standards for therapeutic use exemptions (TUE). Attentiondeﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment within the athletic population is a unique challenge. Stimulants, ﬁrst-line treatment for ADHD, are prohibited unless alternative, nonprohibited medications have ﬁrst been tried and found ineffective. The world prevalence of ADHD is 5.3%; however, there are no ADHD prevalence studies in sports. This paper addresses ADHD in a boys’ gymnastics team, implications for further research with a proposed surveyquestionnaire to measure prevalence of ADHD with behavioral effects of gymnastics, and ethical considerations.\nMethod: Preliminary ADHD prevalence in a boys’ gymnastics team is presented with complementary literature review and a proposed survey-questionnaire to estimate actual ADHD prevalence in gymnastics populations with behavioral effects.\nResults: The parents of boys in a gymnastic reported that 5 of 7 (71.4%) boys were either diagnosed with ADHD in the past or had been treated with stimulant or non-stimulant medications for inattentive/hyperactive/impulsive behaviours. Parents described gymnastics as effective behavioral therapy in controlling/improving ADHD symptoms, with this effect extending into other environments (home/classroom). Only one parent was aware of WADA stimulant prohibition.\nConclusions: A surprisingly large ADHD prevalence is reported in one boys’ gymnastic team. Further research is required to verify this high ADHD prevalence and behavioral effects in gymnastics. A proposed survey-questionnaire to measure both ADHD prevalence and behavioral effects in gymnastics is presented.",

General population studies of ADHD are extensive and have reported on prevalence, symptoms, therapeutic and adverse effects of treatment and new clinical and research findings. However, few studies have reported on prevalence, symptoms and treatments of ADHD in elite athletes. This narrative review summarises the literature on symptoms, comorbidities, effects of ADHD on performance and management options for elite athletes with ADHD. The prevalence of ADHD in student athletes and elite athletes may be 7%–8%. The symptoms and characteristics of ADHD play a role in athletes’ choice of a sport career and further achieving elite status. Proper management of ADHD in elite athletes is important for safety and performance, and options include pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments.",

Guided by an integrated model of athletic performance, we address common concerns raised about stimulant use in sports from our perspective, which we coined the ‘‘performance and health perspective,’’ highlighting relevant research and pointing to gaps in empirical research that should be addressed before bans on use of stimulants for athletes with ADHD are considered. The current article posits that a stimulant ban for athletes with ADHD does not necessarily facilitate fair play, ensure safety, or align with existing policies of large governing bodies. Instead, we recommend that stimulant medication be allowed in high-level sport, following proper diagnosis by a trained professional and a cardiac assessment to conﬁrm no underlying heart conditions. Athletes with ADHD approved to use stimulant medication should be monitored by a health care professional, physically reevaluated and reassessed for ADHD as clinically appropriate and as indicated by relevant sports governing bodies. This performance and health perspective is consistent with that of multiple sport governing bodies who offer therapeutic use.",

      "abstractNote": "Sports psychiatry has developed for the past 3 decades as an emerging field within psychiatry and sports medicine. An International society has been established in 1994 and also national interest groups were implemented, mostly within the national organizations for psychiatry, some also containing the topic of exercise treatment of mental disorders. Where are we now 30 years later? We systematically but also selectively review the medical literature on exercise, sport, psychiatry, mental health and mental disorders and related topics. The number of publications in the field has increased exponentially. Most topics keep remaining on the agenda, e.g., head trauma and concussion, drug abuse and doping, performance enhancement, overtraining, ADHD or eating disorders. Supported by the growing literature, evidence-based recommendations have become available now in many clinical areas. A relatively new phenomenon is muscle dysmorphia, observed in weightlifters, bodybuilders but also in college students and gym users. Further, sports therapy of mental disorders has been studied by more and more high-quality randomized controlled clinical trials. Mostly as a complementary treatment, however, for some disorders already with a 1a evidence level, e.g., depression, dementia or MCI but also post-traumatic stress disorder. Being grown up and accepted nowadays, sports psychiatry still represents a fast-developing field. The reverse side of the coin, sport therapy of mental disorders has received a scientific basis now. Who else than sports psychiatry could advance sport therapy of mental disorders? We need this enthusiasm for sports and psychiatry for our patients with mental disorders and it is time now for a broadening of the scope. Optimized psychiatric prevention and treatment of athletes and ideal sport-related support for individuals with mental disorders should be our main purpose and goal.",

      "abstractNote": "The physical and psychological demands of sports can place an athlete under a variety of stressors. Subsequently, the way in which athletes deal with such stressors can positively or negatively affect their performance. Flow is defined as a type of experience where one is completely engaged in an activity and optimally functioning. Recently, an increase in mindfulness and acceptance based approaches have been utilized as a means to augment negative emotions in sport and many have suggested a link between mindfulness and flow. Thus, if mindfulness can positively influence flow, perhaps performance can also be positively affected. There has also been a need to determine optimal intervention lengths to successfully teach mindfulness practices within sports teams. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of a mindfulness training program on mindfulness scores, dispositional flow scores, and perceived stress scores within a population of Division I female collegiate gymnasts. Results from a repeated measures ANOVA indicated that athletes who participated in the mindfulness training demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the dispositional flow dimensions of loss of self-consciousness and the autotelic experience. These results suggest that mindfulness may influence factors associated with athletic performance.",

Recent Findings Athletes experience similar mental health concerns as non-athlete peers, such as anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation, ADHD, eating disorders, and substance abuse. However, they also experience unique stressors that put them at risk for the development or exacerbation of mental health disorders. Student athletes have to balance academics with rigorous training regimens while focusing on optimal performance and managing high expectations. Physical injuries, overtraining, concussion, sleep disorders, and social identity are some of the factors that also impact the mental health of student athletes.",

      "abstractNote": "The current study investigates the possibility that athletes have more parallel ADHD symptoms than non-athletes. High-level youth sport athletes were compared with non-athletes in leisure time (i.e., sport) and in the school in ADHD symptoms. Athletes and students were evaluated by a trained psychotherapist using Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) on activities at school and during activities in leisure/sports time. They also ﬁlled in the Autism Spectrum Questionnaire (AQ) as a self-report assessment. Results showed signiﬁcant differences in ASRS-scores for athletes in school and in their sport, with high scores in school and low scores in sport. No differences were found in AQ between the groups. The ﬁndings indicate that many athletes might display a cognitive proﬁle of parallel of ADHD criteria. Future research needs to further investigate potential beneﬁts of the cognitive proﬁle in athletes and how they handle different contexts including sport and school settings.",

Data Sources: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Ovid interface. Main Results: ADHD can have many effects on athletes and sports participation. Exercise has positive benefits on ADHD behaviors and players’ attitudes. Athletes with ADHD can have worsened ADHD symptoms after concussions. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a modifier of return to play; baseline ADHD symptoms should be used to guide management. Management should include medications, behavioral/psychosocial therapy, and academic accommodations. Behavioral therapy combined with medication is superior to behavioral treatment alone. Sustained exercise as ADHD treatment should be considered mainstay in management. Sports can increase thermogenic effects of stimulants, heat injury, and cardiac arrhythmias. Increased aggressiveness, improved pain tolerance, and decreased sense of fatigue are some attributes of stimulants that are presumed to impart some advantage to athletes, but evidence is uncertain. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medications may lead to myocardial infarctions, cerebrovascular accidents, paranoid psychoses, seizures, insomnia, tremors, anxiety, hypertension, and death. Conclusions: Athletes’ performance and quality of life can be negatively affected by ADHD. Risks exist for those who take ADHD medications. More research is needed on the implications ADHD may have in specific sports, and on possible advantages of medication use. Potential deleterious effects of these medications should be addressed.",

We also found participants were more lexically dense when accepting and integrating a partner's information (i.e., grounding) but were less lexically dense when responding to a question. Finally, an exploratory analysis suggested that dyads tended to spend more lexical effort when responding to an inquiry and used assent language accurately—that is, only when communication was successful.\n\nConclusion\nTogether, the results suggest that miscommunication both emerges and benefits from ambiguous and lexically dense utterances.",

In response to Tickle-Degnen’s call for a more theoretically complete analysis of the rapport construct, we empirically evaluated her adaptation of Csíkszentmihályi’s optimal experience model with the hope of better conceptualizing rapport’s behavioral manifestations. Dyads (N = 50) engaged in two interdependent tasks and completed a battery of post-task measures gauging their mood dyad and experiences of rapport. To complement self-report measures, we coded rapport-based behavior using both subjective (thin-slice judgments) and objective (Motion Energy Analysis) methodologies. According to Tickle-Degnen’s model, dyadic exchanges with moderate levels of expressivity and interpersonal coordination should yield the highest levels of rapport. Although data from our objective coding did not trend in this manner, subjective measurements of coordinated expressivity matched the paradigm’s prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first study to empirically support Tickle-Degnen’s hypothesis and a novel step toward clarifying the rapport construct.",

      "abstractNote": "Emotional bookkeeping is the process by which primates integrate the emotional effects of social interactions to form internal representations of their affiliative relationships. The dynamics and speed of this process, which comprises the formation, maintenance and fading out of affiliative relationships, are not clear. Empirical data suggest that affiliative relationships are slowly formed and do not easily fade out. The EMO-model, an agent-based model designed to simulate the social life of primates capable of emotional bookkeeping, was used to explore the effects of different types of internal relationship dynamics and speeds of increase and decrease of relationship strength. In the original EMO-model the internal dynamics involves a fast built-up of a relationship independent of its current quality, alongside a relatively fast fading out of relationship quality. Here we explore the effect of this original dynamics and an alternative dynamics more in line with empirical data, in combination with different speeds of internal relationship quality increase and decrease, on the differentiation and stability of affiliative relationships. The alternative dynamics leads to more differentiated and stable affiliative relationships than the original dynamics, especially when the speed with which internal relationship quality increases is low and the speed with which it decreases is intermediate. Consequently, individuals can groom different group members with varying frequency and support a rich social life with stable preferred partners and attention to several others. In conclusion, differentiated and stable affiliative relationships are especially formed when friends are not made too quickly and not forgotten too easily.",

      "abstractNote": "Multi-agent collaboration is greatly important in order to reduce the frequency of errors in message communication and enhance the consistency of exchanging information. This study explores the process of evolutionary decision and stable strategies among multi-agent systems, including followers, leaders, and loners, involved in collaboration based on evolutionary game theory (EGT). The main elements that affected the strategies are discussed, and a 3D evolution model is established. The evolutionary stability strategy (ESS) and stable conditions were analyzed subsequently. Numerical simulation results were obtained through MATLAB simulation, and they manifested that leaders play an important role in exchanging information with other agents, accepting agents’ state information, and sending messages to agents. Then, with the positivity of receiving and feeding back messages for followers, implementing message communication is proﬁtable for the system, and the high positivity can accelerate the exchange of information. At the behavior level, reducing costs can strengthen the punishment of impeding the exchange of information and improve the positivity of collaboration to facilitate the evolutionary convergence toward the ideal state. Finally, the EGT results revealed that the possibility of collaboration between loners and others is improved, and the rewards are increased, thereby promoting the implementation of message communication that encourages leaders to send all messages, improve the feedback positivity of followers, and reduce the hindering degree of loners.",

      "abstractNote": "Purpose:  In small cooperative and collaborative groups, patterns of interaction, discourse and dialogue are often strongly bidirectional; ties are reciprocal and reciprocated. This reciprocation of ties leads to the formation of interaction patterns that are reciprocated dyads (two individuals connected reciprocally) and triads (three individuals connected reciprocally). In this study, we use an agent-based model to explore how such reciprocated dyadic and triadic patterns emerge from self-reinforced appreciation between peers in a small group.\nMethods:  The model assumes that the agents’ decisions to interact depend on how their self-appreciation compares to their appreciations of their peers (peer-appreciation). These comparisons are competitive in that an agent seek to increase its appreciation in relation to its peers. As a consequence, agents change their self-appreciation and appreciation towards their peers depending on their sensitivity to the competitive comparison.\nResults:  When agents’ sensitivity to competitive comparisons is low, the most common patterns of appreciation are egalitarian triads (all three agents appreciate each other), while for moderate sensitivity, leadership-type patterns emerge (one agent connected strongly to two other unconnected agents). When sensitivity is high, strong reciprocally connected dyads emerge. The model thus predicts thus a transition from egalitarian triads to strong dyads as agents’ sensitivity to competitive comparisons increases.\nConclusions:  The structural similarity between patterns emerging as model results and patterns reported in empirical research suggests that: (1) reciprocation based on appreciation is a strong candidate for explaining the formation of such patterns, and (2) individual sensitivity to competitive comparisons of appreciation may be a key factor that can be used to the tune dynamics of interaction in small groups.",

      "abstractNote": "Discourse patterns in a small group are assumed to form largely through the group’s internal social dynamics when group members compete for floor in discourse. Here we approach such discourse pattern formation through the agent-based model (ABM). In the ABM introduced here the agents’ interactions and participation in discussions are dependent on the agents’ inherent potential activity to participate in discussion and on realised, externalised activity, discursivity. The discourse patterns are assumed to be outcomes of peerto-peer comparison events, where agents competitively compare their activities and discursivities, and where activities also a ect agents’ cooperation in increasing the discursivity, i.e. floor for discourse. These two e ects and their influence on discourse pattern formation are parameterised as comptetivity α and cooperativity λ. The discourse patterns are here based on the agents’ discursivity. The patterns in groups of four agents up to seven agents are characterised through triadic census (i.e. though counting triadic sub-patterns). The cases of low competitivity α is shown to give rise to fully connected egalitarian, triadic patterns, which with increasing competitivity are transformed to strong dyadic patterns. An increase in cooperativity λ enhances the emergence of egalitarian triads and helps to maintain the formation of fully and partially connected triadic pattern also in cases of high competitivity. In larger groups of six and seven agents, isolation becomes common, in contrast to groups of four agents where isolation is relatively rare. These results are in concordance with known empirical findings of discourse and participation patterns in small groups.",

      "abstractNote": "Existing agent-based models of emotion contagion that account for the emotional diversity in groups have mostly focussed on the spread of categorical emotions (happy, sad, angry). In practice this raises problems with regard to how the spread of different emotions should interact. Can one be both very happy and very angry at the same time, or shift quickly between these states? And which emotion should determine the behaviour of an agent? The present paper explores an alternative where dimensional emotions spread in a crowd and the emotional state of an agent equals its location in the valencearousal space, corresponding to a single emotion. We propose an agent-based model that is an extension of the ASCRIBE model. Furthermore, building on recent work that found an attention bias in participants toward emotionally salient stimuli, we examine the effects of attention bias in the context of emotion contagion at the crowd level.",

      "abstractNote": "Human-AI interaction is pervasive across many areas of our day to day lives. In this paper, we investigate human-AI collaboration in the context of a collaborative AI-driven word association game with partially observable information. In our experiments, we test various dimensions of subjective social perceptions (rapport, intelligence, creativity and likeability) of participants towards their partners when participants believe they are playing with an AI or with a human. We also test subjective social perceptions of participants towards their partners when participants are presented with a variety of confidence levels. We ran a large scale study on Mechanical Turk (n=164) of this collaborative game. Our results show that when participants believe their partners were human, they found their partners to be more likeable, intelligent, creative and having more rapport and use more positive words to describe their partner’s attributes than when they believed they were interacting with an AI partner. We also found no differences in game outcome including win rate and turns to completion. Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative findings, we discuss AI agent transparency, include design implications for tools incorporating or supporting human-AI collaboration, and lay out directions for future research. Our findings lead to implications for other forms of human-AI interaction and communication.

A turn-taking version of the Tower of Hanoi game was used, where physiological arousal and valence underlying such human-robot proximate collaboration were investigated. A comparable decision performance in the serious game was found between human and nonhumanoid robot arm collaborator conditions, while higher physiological affect was found in humans collaborating with such robot collaborators. It is suggested that serious games which are carefully designed to take into consideration the elicited physiological arousal might witness a better decision-making performance and more positive valence using non-humanoid robot partners instead of human ones.",

      "abstractNote": "Movement science has traditionally understood high-dimensional ﬂuctuations as either antithetical or irrelevant to low-dimensional control. However, ﬂuctuations incident to changeful, sometimes unpredictable stimulation must somehow reshape low-dimensional aspects of control through perception. The movement system’s ﬂuctuations may reﬂect cascade dynamics in which many-sized events interact nonlinearly across many scales. Cascades yield fractal ﬂuctuations, and fractality of ﬂuctuations may provide a window on the interactions across scale supporting perceptual processes. To test these ideas, we asked adult human participants to judge whole or partial length for unseen rods (with and without added masses). The participants’ only experience with the objects came from supporting them across their shoulders during quiet standing. First, the degree of fractal temporal correlations in trial-by-trial series of planar Euclidean displacements in center of pressure (COP) signiﬁcantly improved prediction of subsequent trial-by-trial judgments, above and beyond prediction by traditional predictors of haptic perception and conventional measures of COP variability. Second, comparison with linear surrogate data indicated the presence of nonlinear interactions across scale in these time series. These results demonstrate that high-dimensional ﬂuctuations may serve a crucial role in the cascade dynamics supporting apparently low-dimensional control strategies.",

      "abstractNote": "This article explores the dynamics of collaborative learning in the classroom from the perspective of the commonalities and interdependence in the degree of physiological activation from the sympathetic nervous system (i.e., sympathetic arousal) of group members. Using Empatica E4 wristbands, electrodermal activity—to derive arousal—was measured in 24 high school students working in groups of three (i.e., triads) during two runs of an advanced physics course. The participants met three times a week over six weeks for lessons of 75 min each. Most of the time (≈60–95% of the lesson) the triad members were at different arousal levels, and, when they were on the same level, it was mainly the low arousal (or deactivated) level. Less than 4% of the time were the triad members simultaneously in high arousal. Possible within-triad arousal contagion cases (71.3%) occurred mostly on a one-to-one basis and with a latency from within a few seconds up to 10 min, but usually within 1 min. This study supports the view that only small parts of group work are collaborative, as far as the synchronicity and coordination which collaboration presupposes. Although exploratory, results also illustrate the affordances of physiological measures to characterize collaborative processes.",

We first review some basic characteristics of eye movements during reading and then present two studies in which eye movements are monitored to confirm that eye movements are sensitive to (a) global text passage difficulty and (b) inconsistencies in text. We demonstrate that processing times increased (and especially that the number of fixations increased) when text is difficult. When there is an inconsistency, readers fixated longer on the region where the inconsistency occurred. In both studies, the probability of making a regressive eye movement increased as well. Finally, we discuss the use of eye movement recording as a research tool to further study moment-to-moment comprehension processes and the possibility of using this tool in more applied school settings.",

This measure includes reading speed (seconds to read) in the denominator and percentage of comprehension questions answered correctly in the numerator. Participants were 22 4th-, 29 5th-, and 37 10th-grade students. Results showed that reading speed accounted for much of the variance in Broad Reading Cluster scores and subtest scores of the Woodcock–Johnson III Tests of Achievement across all grade levels. Converting reading speed to the rate measure %C/M increased Broad Reading Cluster variance accounted for in the 4th- and 5th-grade sample, but decreased the Broad Reading Cluster variance accounted for in the 10th-grade sample. Discussion focuses on the importance of reading speed and the failure to enhance validity of a brief rate measure in more skilled readers by incorporating a direct measure of comprehension. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

      "abstractNote": "The human haptic perceptual system respects a bodywide organization that responds to local stimulation through full-bodied coordination of nested tensions and compressions across multiple nonoverlapping scales. Under such an organization, the suprapostural task of manually hefting objects to perceive their heaviness and length should depend on roots extending into the postural control for maintaining upright balance on the ground surface. Postural sway of the whole body should thus carry signatures predicting what the hand can extract by hefting an object. We found that fractal fluctuations in Euclidean displacement in the participants' center of pressure (CoP) contributed to perceptual judgments by moderating how the participants' hand picked up the informational variable of the moment of inertia. The role of fractality in CoP displacement in supporting heaviness and length judgments increased across trials, indicating that the participants progressively implicate their fractal scaling in their perception of heaviness and length. Traditionally, we had to measure fractality in hand movements to predict perceptual judgments by manual hefting. However, our findings suggest that we can observe what is happening at hand in the relatively distant-from-hand measure of CoP. Our findings reveal the complex relationship through which posture supports manual exploration, entailing perception of the intended properties of hefted objects (heaviness or length) putatively through the redistribution of forces throughout the body.",

Understanding the temporal dynamics of team processes and related team phenomena with a high-resolution lens (i.e., methods with high sampling rates) is particularly challenging when going “into the wild” (i.e., studying teams operating in their full situated context). We review quantitative field studies using high-resolution methods (e.g., video, chat/text data, archival, wearables) and map out the various temporal lenses for studying team dynamics. We synthesize these different lenses and present an integrated temporal framework that is of help in theorizing about team dynamics. We also provide readers with a “how to” guide that summarizes four essential steps along with analytical methods (e.g., sequential and pattern analyses, mixed-methods research, abductive reasoning) that are applicable to the broad scope of high-resolution methods.",

One participant alone might change her own response over time. Participants vary further in their use of feedback through one modality to inform another modality. Two experiments test the general hypothesis that perceptual-motor fluctuations reveal both information use within modality and coordination among modalities. Experiment 1 focuses on perceptual learning in dynamic touch, in which participants use exploratory handwielding of unseen objects to make visually guided length judgments and use visual feedback to rescale their judgments of the same mechanical information. Previous research found that the degree of fractal temporal scaling (i.e., “fractality”) in handwielding moderates the use of mechanical information. Experiment 1 shows that head-sway fractality moderates the use of visual information. Further, experience with feedback increases head-sway fractality and prolongs its effect on later hand-wielding fractality. Experiment 2 replicates effects of head-sway fractality moderating use of visual information in a purely visual judgment task. Together, these findings suggest that fractal fluctuations may provide a modal-general window onto not just how participants use perceptual information but also how well they may integrate information among different modalities.",

      "abstractNote": "Perceptual systems must learn to explore and to use the resulting information to hone performance. Optimal performance depends on using information available at many time scales, from the near instantaneous values of variables underlying perception (i.e., detection), to longer term information about appropriate scaling (i.e., calibration), to yet longer term information guiding variable use (i.e., attunement). Fractal fluctuations in explorations would entail fluctuation at all time scales, allowing perceptual systems a flexible way to detect information at all time scales. We tested whether perceptual learning in dynamic touch is related to the fractality of wielding behaviors. A reanalysis of wielding behaviors from Arzamarski, Isenhower, Kay, Turvey, and Michaels (2010) revealed that exploratory movements were fractal and that a fractal-scaling exponent predicts individual differences in haptic judgments.",

      "abstractNote": "Because both emotional arousal and regulation are continuous, ongoing processes, it is difficult, if not impossible, to separate them. Thus, affective dynamics can reveal the regulation of emotion as it occurs in real time. One way that this can be done is through the examination of intra- and interpersonal flexibility or the transitions into and out of affective states. The present article reviews and then expands upon the Flex3 model of real-time dynamic and reactive flexibility, specifying the ways in which individual differences in emotion regulation manifest as differences in flexibility. The differences in results at the real-time scale versus diurnal variability are also discussed within an emotion regulation framework.",

In a laboratory study, we examine team decision making over time and draw causal inferences about the relationships among team emotions, team performance, and explore–exploit decisions. We use self‐report data to measure team emotions, and validate results with psychophysiological data. We find that declines in performance increase the likelihood that teams decide to explore new routines rather than exploit existing ones. We also find a marginal positive effect of positive emotions, as measured by both self‐report and psychophysiological data, on team decisions to explore a new routine. Further, teams successful at implementing new routines report increased positive emotions, as measured by the self‐report data. This relationship is fully mediated by performance change.\n              Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

A model, based on previous ®ndings, was proposed for artistic preference which included personality traits, demographic variables, and previous experience of art. Four distinct styles of paintings (Representational, Abstract, Pop-Art and Japanese traditional) were used to measure preference for art. Participants (101) rated 40 paintings on several rating scales. It was found that conservatism, sex, familiarity and certain measures of prior exposure to art were strongest predictors of preference. The model as a whole accounted for between 16 and 32% of the variance in preference, indicating that other factors were in¯uencing preference. Various links between personality variables and preference found by previous research were not replicated. The concept of preference for, or avoidance of novelty was used to attempt to integrate the ®ndings from this and other studies. # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "abstractNote": "In recent years, many agent-based models of human groups have implemented a mechanism of emotion contagion, yet empirical validation is lagging behind. The aim of the present paper is to validate an agent-based model of emotion contagion at the level of group emotion, by comparing simulations against the emotional development of real people in small groups. To study the effect of emotion contagion, the participants interacted via a video call, where they were virtually placed in different social environments while they played a quiz. This allowed the exchange of emotion among all, some or none of the participants. The patterns of emotional development in the empirical results supported our hypotheses based on literature of emotion contagion and social norms. Further, the simulations with the complete model resembled many of these patterns. When emotion contagion was disabled in the model, the resemblance decreased. These results give a ﬁrst indication that emotion contagion occurs in groups that meet via video calls, and can in-part be predicted by the proposed model of emotion contagion. Yet, further study with a larger and more diverse empirical sample is needed, as well as comparisons across contagion mechanisms, to draw stronger conclusions and ultimately justify societal application.",

      "abstractNote": "Discourse patterns in a small group are assumed to form largely through the group’s internal social dynamics when group members compete for floor in discourse. Here we approach such discourse pattern formation through the agent-based model (ABM). In the ABM introduced here the agents’ interactions and participation in discussions are dependent on the agents’ inherent potential activity to participate in discussion and on realised, externalised activity, discursivity. The discourse patterns are assumed to be outcomes of peerto-peer comparison events, where agents competitively compare their activities and discursivities, and where activities also a ect agents’ cooperation in increasing the discursivity, i.e. floor for discourse. These two e ects and their influence on discourse pattern formation are parameterised as comptetivity α and cooperativity λ. The discourse patterns are here based on the agents’ discursivity. The patterns in groups of four agents up to seven agents are characterised through triadic census (i.e. though counting triadic sub-patterns). The cases of low competitivity α is shown to give rise to fully connected egalitarian, triadic patterns, which with increasing competitivity are transformed to strong dyadic patterns. An increase in cooperativity λ enhances the emergence of egalitarian triads and helps to maintain the formation of fully and partially connected triadic pattern also in cases of high competitivity. In larger groups of six and seven agents, isolation becomes common, in contrast to groups of four agents where isolation is relatively rare. These results are in concordance with known empirical findings of discourse and participation patterns in small groups.",

      "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            The Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS) were constructed as a self-report assessment to measure individual differences in Jaak Panksepp’s cross-species primary emotional systems: SEEKING, PLAY, CARE (positive emotions) and FEAR, SADNESS, ANGER (negative emotions). Beginning with the first published work on the ANPS in 2003, individual differences on the ANPS measures of these six primary emotional systems have been consistently linked to Big Five personality traits. From a theoretical perspective, these primary emotional systems arising from subcortical regions, shed light on the nature of the Big Five personality traits from an evolutionary perspective, because each of these primary emotional systems represent a tool for survival endowing mammalian species with inherited behavioral programs to react appropriately to complex environments. The present work revisited 21 available samples where both ANPS and Big Five measures have been administered. Our meta-analytical analysis provides solid evidence that high SEEKING relates to high Openness to Experience, high PLAY to high Extraversion, high CARE/low ANGER to high Agreeableness and high FEAR/SADNESS/ANGER to high Neuroticism. This seems to be true regardless of the ANPS inventory chosen, although much more work is needed in this area. Associations between primary emotional systems and Conscientiousness were in the lower effect size area across all six primary emotions, thereby supporting the idea that Conscientiousness rather seems to be less directly related with the subcortical primary emotions and likely is the most cognitive/cortical personality construct out of the Big Five. In sum, the present work underlines the idea that individual differences in primary emotional systems represent evolutionarily ancient foundations of human personality, given their a) meaningful links to the prominent Big Five model and b) their origins lying in subcortical areas of the human brain.",

      "abstractNote": "Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is an essential skill in the 21st century. There is a need for an appropriate framework and operationalization of CPS to guide its assessment and support and across multiple domains. Accordingly, we synthesized prior research on CPS to construct a generalized CPS competency model (i.e., skills and abilities) consisting of the following core facets: constructing shared knowledge, negotiation/coordination, and maintaining team function. Each facet has two sub-facets, which in turn, have multiple verbal and nonverbal indicators. We validated our model in two empirical studies involving triadic CPS, but in very different contexts – middle-school students playing an educational game in a 3-hour, face-to-face session vs. college students engaging in a visual programming task for 20 minutes via videoconferencing. We used principal component analysis to investigate whether the empirical data aligned with our theorized model. Correlational analyses provided evidence on the orthogonality of the facets and their independence to individual differences in prior knowledge, intelligence and personality and regression analyses indicated that the facets predicted both subjective and objective outcome measures controlling for several covariates. Thus we provide initial evidence for the convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity of our model by using two different CPS contexts and student populations. This shows promise towards generalizing across various human-human CPS interactive environments.",

      "abstractNote": "Understanding subjective well-being (SWB) has historically been a core human endeavor and presently spans fields from management to mental health. Previous meta-analyses have indicated that personality traits are one of the best predictors. Still, these past results indicate only a moderate relationship, weaker than suggested by several lines of reasoning. This may be because of commensurability, where researchers have grouped together substantively disparate measures in their analyses. In this article, the authors review and address this problem directly, focusing on individual measures of personality (e.g., the Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness Personality Inventory; P. T. Costa & R. R. McCrae, 1992) and categories of SWB (e.g., life satisfaction). In addition, the authors take a multivariate approach, assessing how much variance personality traits account for individually as well as together. Results indicate that different personality and SWB scales can be substantively different and that the relationship between the two is typically much larger (e.g., 4 times) than previous meta-analyses have indicated. Total SWB variance accounted for by personality can reach as high as 39% or 63% disattenuated.

      "abstractNote": "Existing agent-based models of emotion contagion that account for the emotional diversity in groups have mostly focussed on the spread of categorical emotions (happy, sad, angry). In practice this raises problems with regard to how the spread of different emotions should interact. Can one be both very happy and very angry at the same time, or shift quickly between these states? And which emotion should determine the behaviour of an agent? The present paper explores an alternative where dimensional emotions spread in a crowd and the emotional state of an agent equals its location in the valencearousal space, corresponding to a single emotion. We propose an agent-based model that is an extension of the ASCRIBE model. Furthermore, building on recent work that found an attention bias in participants toward emotionally salient stimuli, we examine the effects of attention bias in the context of emotion contagion at the crowd level.",

      "abstractNote": "Purpose:  In small cooperative and collaborative groups, patterns of interaction, discourse and dialogue are often strongly bidirectional; ties are reciprocal and reciprocated. This reciprocation of ties leads to the formation of interaction patterns that are reciprocated dyads (two individuals connected reciprocally) and triads (three individuals connected reciprocally). In this study, we use an agent-based model to explore how such reciprocated dyadic and triadic patterns emerge from self-reinforced appreciation between peers in a small group.\nMethods:  The model assumes that the agents’ decisions to interact depend on how their self-appreciation compares to their appreciations of their peers (peer-appreciation). These comparisons are competitive in that an agent seek to increase its appreciation in relation to its peers. As a consequence, agents change their self-appreciation and appreciation towards their peers depending on their sensitivity to the competitive comparison.\nResults:  When agents’ sensitivity to competitive comparisons is low, the most common patterns of appreciation are egalitarian triads (all three agents appreciate each other), while for moderate sensitivity, leadership-type patterns emerge (one agent connected strongly to two other unconnected agents). When sensitivity is high, strong reciprocally connected dyads emerge. The model thus predicts thus a transition from egalitarian triads to strong dyads as agents’ sensitivity to competitive comparisons increases.\nConclusions:  The structural similarity between patterns emerging as model results and patterns reported in empirical research suggests that: (1) reciprocation based on appreciation is a strong candidate for explaining the formation of such patterns, and (2) individual sensitivity to competitive comparisons of appreciation may be a key factor that can be used to the tune dynamics of interaction in small groups.",

      "abstractNote": "Group coordination is deﬁned as interactions with other members to implement a task that is difﬁcult to do alone or to achieve higher performance than an individual. Meanwhile, the adjustment process in coordination is not uniquely determined because each individual has many degrees of freedom. It is more difﬁcult to explain and model complex and dynamic coordination, such as nonverbal behavior of three or more members than pair or verbal interaction. Hence, we previously introduced a coordinated drawing task and conducted the behavioral experiment. The triads operated reels to change the tensions of threads connected to a pen, shared three heterogeneous roles (pulling, relaxing, and adjusting), and moved the pen to draw an equilateral triangle. The results indicated that the adjusting role was related to high task performance by helping resiliently without disturbing the pen’s smooth movement while avoiding great pen deviation. However, this experiment alone cannot explain details of the adjustment process of tension. To supplement these ﬁndings, this study formulated the three roles using equations of motion. The multi-agent simulation results showed that the adjusting role might use the degree of pen deviation reﬂected by the others’ motor information, such as the operating procedures and forces, to change the tension and draw at least three sides. Although it is necessary to consider that we used the experimental task, our study contributes to the fundamental understanding of resilient adjustment in coordination by sharing heterogeneous roles as the ﬁrst step.",

      "abstractNote": "Multi-agent collaboration is greatly important in order to reduce the frequency of errors in message communication and enhance the consistency of exchanging information. This study explores the process of evolutionary decision and stable strategies among multi-agent systems, including followers, leaders, and loners, involved in collaboration based on evolutionary game theory (EGT). The main elements that affected the strategies are discussed, and a 3D evolution model is established. The evolutionary stability strategy (ESS) and stable conditions were analyzed subsequently. Numerical simulation results were obtained through MATLAB simulation, and they manifested that leaders play an important role in exchanging information with other agents, accepting agents’ state information, and sending messages to agents. Then, with the positivity of receiving and feeding back messages for followers, implementing message communication is proﬁtable for the system, and the high positivity can accelerate the exchange of information. At the behavior level, reducing costs can strengthen the punishment of impeding the exchange of information and improve the positivity of collaboration to facilitate the evolutionary convergence toward the ideal state. Finally, the EGT results revealed that the possibility of collaboration between loners and others is improved, and the rewards are increased, thereby promoting the implementation of message communication that encourages leaders to send all messages, improve the feedback positivity of followers, and reduce the hindering degree of loners.",

      "abstractNote": "Humans often share roles and aim to achieve a group goal based on sociality, which is the tendency to spontaneously involve oneself with others. Cognitive science, psychology, and neuroscience studies suggest that in such planned coordination, adjusting one’s own actions based on other roles is crucial for high task performance. However, the mechanisms of complex and dynamically planned coordination, such as non-verbal group behavior with three or more members, remain to be fully investigated. This study introduced a coordinated drawing task in a triad, quantitatively analyzed non-verbal group behavior based on sharing heterogeneous roles, and investigated an important role. Participant triads engaged in the task repeatedly by operating reels to change thread tensions and moving a pen connected to the three threads to draw an equilateral triangle. Then, the three roles (pulling, relaxing, and adjusting) had to be shared. The pulling and relaxing roles served to move the pen as if an operator pulled it closer to the hand and to support the pen’s movement, respectively. However, these roles alone could not draw a side considering the task specification. The adjusting role needed to change the tension flexibly and maintain an overall balance. In the experiment, we measured the pen positions and tensions, and established statistical models to fit the analyzed data. The results estimated that the action in the adjusting role was related to the improved performance of faster drawing on a side. This role may moderately intervene in the actions by the other roles and fine-tune without disturbing the pen’s smooth movement while avoiding great pen deviation. Our findings may suggest the crucial role as a facilitator that handles resiliently in non-verbal coordinated behavior of a triad, and contribute to our understanding of social interactions.",

In an AI-driven cooperative game with partially observable information, players (be it the AI or the human player) require their actions to be interpreted accurately by the other player to yield a successful outcome. In this paper, we investigate social perceptions of AI agents with various directions of communication in a cooperative game setting. We measure subjective social perceptions (rapport, intelligence, and likeability) of participants towards their partners when participants believe they are playing with an AI or with a human and the nature of the communication (responsiveness and leading roles). We ran a large scale study on Mechanical Turk (n=199) of this collaborative game and fnd signifcant diferences in gameplay outcome and social perception across diferent AI agents, diferent directions of communication and when the agent is perceived to be an AI/Human. We fnd that the bias against the AI that has been demonstrated in prior studies varies with the direction of the communication and with the AI agent.",

      "abstractNote": "Our daily human life is filled with a myriad of joint action moments, be it children playing, adults working together (i.e., team sports), or strangers navigating through a crowd. Joint action brings individuals (and embodiment of their emotions) together, in space and in time. Yet little is known about how individual emotions propagate through embodied presence in a group, and how joint action changes individual emotion. In fact, the multi-agent component is largely missing from neuroscience-based approaches to emotion, and reversely joint action research has not found a way yet to include emotion as one of the key parameters to model socio-motor interaction. In this review, we first identify the gap and then stockpile evidence showing strong entanglement between emotion and acting together from various branches of sciences. We propose an integrative approach to bridge the gap, highlight five research avenues to do so in behavioral neuroscience and digital sciences, and address some of the key challenges in the area faced by modern societies.",

Factor analysis reduced this to a 20-item scale that was administered 1 year later to 357 different adolescents in Year 10 in the same schools. Conﬁrmatory factor analysis veriﬁed the two-factor solution. Females scored higher than males on both affective and cognitive empathy. Empathy was positively correlated with intelligence (for females only), extraversion (cognitive empathy only) neuroticism (affective empathy only), agreeableness, conscientiousness (for males only), and openness. Empathy was positively related to parental supervision and socioeconomic status. Adolescents who would help victims of bullying had high empathy.",

      "abstractNote": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the commonest psychiatric disorders in children. Stimulants are frequently used in the management of ADHD. Due to adverse effects of medication there is a growing interest in complementary treatments. Complementary and alternative medicine therapies including yoga are commonly used in children with ADHD, but little is known about the efficacy of these therapies. Yoga requires long periods of concentration and is therefore supposed to reduce attention deficits. The published investigations without a control group report positive effects of yoga on ADHD symptoms and school performance. However, these studies do not allow causal conclusions in regard to the effects of yoga in the treatment of ADHD. The findings from exploratory randomized controlled studies suggest that future research on the efficacy of yoga in ADHD may yield results of therapeutic value. At present the small number of available investigations renders impossible the drawing of any conclusions regarding the effectiveness of yoga for ADHD in children. Large, well-controlled, randomized trials are needed in order to establish the potential value of yoga as a single treatment or adjunct to standard ADHD therapies.",

      "abstractNote": "This chapter describes models of eye movements while people read text. All of the models have the core assumption that the primary “engine” that drives the eyes forward on text is the serial identification of words in text. However, the relationship among the identification of a word, the forward movement of attention, and the program to fixate the subsequent word is not completely straightforward. Silent reading is one of the most important skills humans master and it is certainly one of the most frequent complex cognitive acts most adults perform. A powerful tool for understanding reading is examining the pattern of eye movements while people silently read text for meaning. It was believed that little could be learned from eye movements in reading because it was hypothesized that the cognitive acts in reading were too slow to be responsive to the system that was generating eye movements three to four times a second. However, it is now clear that the moment-to-moment pattern of eye movements is responsive to aspects of the meaning of the text—such as the frequency of a word in the language—and therefore cognitive acts—such as recognizing a word—do influence the behavior of the eyes in a moment-to-moment fashion.",

AutoTutor is an animated pedagogical agent that holds a conversation in natural language, with spoken contributions by the learner. Thirty students completed a multiple-choice pre-test, a 35-minute training session, and a multiple-choice post-test. The students reviewed the tutorial interaction and were stopped at strategically sampled points for emotion judgments. They judged what emotions they experienced on the basis of the dialogue history and their facial expressions. The emotions they judged were boredom, flow (engagement), frustration, confusion, delight, surprise, and neutral. A multiple regression analysis revealed that post-test scores were significantly predicted by pre-test scores and confusion, but not by any of the other emotions.",

To date, only a few psychopathology relevant studies have systematically quantiﬁed HRV-HF proﬁles using more ecologically valid methods in everyday life. Using an experience-sampling approach, the present study examined both mean levels and intra-individual variability of HRV-HF – as well as comparison measures of cardiovascular arousal, sympathetic activity, and gross somatic movement – in everyday life, using ambulatory psychophysiological measurement across a six-day consecutive period among a spectrum of community adult participants with varying degrees of positive valence system disturbance, including adults with bipolar I disorder (BD; n = 21), major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 17), and healthy non-psychiatric controls (CTL; n = 28). Groups did not differ in mean HRV-HF, but greater HRVHF instability (i.e., intra-individual variation in HRV-HF) was found in the BD compared to both MDD and CTL groups. Subsequent analyses suggested that group differences in HRV-HF variability were largely accounted for by variations in clinician-rated manic symptoms. However, no association was found between HRV-HF variability and dimensional measures of positive affectivity. This work provides evidence consistent with a quadratic relationship between HRV-HF and positive emotional disturbance and represents a valuable step toward developing a more ecologically valid model of positive valence system disturbances and their underlying psychophysiological mechanisms within an RDoC framework.",

      "abstractNote": "Evidence suggests affective disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder are characterised by dysregulated autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. These findings suggest ANS dysregulation may be involved in the pathogenesis of affective disorders. Different affective states are characterised by different ANS activity patterns (i.e., an increase or decrease in sympathetic or parasympathetic activity). To understand how ANS abnormalities are involved in the development of affective disorders, it is important to understand how affective states correlate with ANS activity before their onset. Using heart rate variability (HRV) as a tool to measure ANS activity, this review aimed to look at associations between affective states and HRV in non-clinical populations (i.e., in those without medical and psychiatric disorders). Searches on PubMed and Google Scholar were completed using the following search terms: heart rate variability, autonomic nervous system, sympathetic nervous system, para­ sympathetic nervous system, affective state, mood and emotion in all possible combinations. All but one of the studies examined (N = 13), demonstrated significant associations between affect and HRV. Findings suggest negative affect, encompassing both diffused longer-term experiences (i.e., mood) as well as more focused shortterm experiences (i.e., emotions), may be associated with a reduction in parasympathetic activity as measured through HRV parameters known to quantify parasympathetic activity (e.g., high frequency (HF)-HRV). HRV measures typically linked to reduction in parasympathetic activity appear to be linked to negative affective states in non-clinical populations. However, given the complex and possibly non-linear relationship between HRV and parasympathetic activity, further studies need to clarify specificity of these findings. Future studies should investigate the potential utility of HRV measures as biomarkers for monitoring changes in affective states and for early detection of onset and relapse of depression in patients with affective disorders.",

We used Motion Energy Analysis to examine Social Motor Synchrony (SMS) in familiar partners of the same neurotype: pairs of autistic and of neurotypical children. Partners played two shared tablet activities, one to support collaboration by facilitating engagement and other-awareness (Connect), and one with no additional design features to facilitate collaboration (Colours). The neurotypical group showed similar SMS to the autistic group in Colours but lower SMS in Connect. The autistic group displayed similar levels of SMS in each activity. Autistic children can synchronise to a similar, or greater, degree than neurotypical children when the social context and type of task are considered.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent theories emphasize the dynamic aspects of emotions. However, the physiological measures and the methodological approaches that can capture the dynamics of emotions are underdeveloped. In the current study, we investigated whether moment-to-moment changes in autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity are reliably associated with the unfolding of emotional experience. We obtained cardiovascular and electrodermal signals from participants while they viewed emotional movies. We found that the ANS signals were temporally aligned across individuals, indicating a reliable stimulus-driven response. The degree of response reliability was associated with the emotional time line of the movie. Finally, individual differences in ANS response reliability were strongly correlated with the subjective emotional responses. The current research offers a methodological approach for studying physiological responses during dynamic emotional situations.",

      "abstractNote": "Joint performance can lead to the synchronization of physiological processes among group members during a shared task. Recently, it has been shown that synchronization is indicative of subjective ratings of group processes and task performance. However, different methods have been used to quantify synchronization, and ­little is known about the effects of the choice of method and level of analysis (individuals, dyads, or triads) on the results. In this study, participants performed a decision-m­ aking task in groups of three while physiological signals (heart rate and electrodermal ­activity), positive affective behavior, and personality traits were measured. First, we investigated the effects of different levels of analysis of physiological synchrony on affective behavior. We computed synchrony measures as (a) individual contributions to group synchrony, (b) the average dyadic synchrony within a group, and (c) group-­level synchrony. Second, we assessed the association between ­physiological ­synchrony and positive affective behavior. Third, we investigated the moderating effects of trait anxiety and social phobia on behavior. We discovered that the effects of physiological synchrony on positive affective behavior were particularly strong at the group level but nonsignificant at the individual and dyadic levels. Moreover, we found that heart rate and electrodermal synchronization showed ­opposite effects on group members' display of affective behavior. Finally, trait anxiety moderated the relationship between physiological synchrony and affective behavior, perhaps due to social uncertainty, while social phobia did not have a moderating effect. We discuss these results regarding the role of different physiological signals and task demands during joint action.",

      "abstractNote": "The theory of socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) suggests that successful collaborative groups can identify and respond to trigger events stemming from cognitive or emotional obstacles in learning. Thus, to develop real-time support for SSRL, novel metrics are needed to identify different types of trigger events that invite SSRL. Our aim was to apply two metrics derived from different data streams to study how trigger events for SSRL shaped group linguistic alignment (based on audio data) and physiological synchrony (based on electrodermal activity data). The data came from six groups of students (N = 18) as they worked face-to-face on a collaborative learning task with one cognitive and two emotional trigger events. We found that the cognitive trigger event increased linguistic alignment in task-description words and led to physiological out-of-synchrony. The emotional trigger events decreased out-of-synchrony and increased high-arousal synchrony at the physiological level but did not affect linguistic alignment. Therefore, different metrics for studying markers and responses to different types of trigger events are needed, suggesting the necessity for multimodal learning analytics to support collaborative learning.",

Articles were coded on several dimensions, including team characteristics. Study findings were categorized by relationships tested between team physiological dynamics (TPD) and team inputs, mediators/processes, outputs, or psychometric properties.\nResults: TPD researchers overwhelmingly measure single physiological systems. Although there is research linking TPD to inputs and outputs, the research on processes is underdeveloped.\nConclusion: We recommend several theoretical, methodological, and statistical themes to expand the growth of the TPD field.",

      "abstractNote": "Interpersonal physiological synchrony is the spontaneous temporal coordination of physiological processes be­ tween several individuals. This type of synchrony is critical for human relationships, as it promotes two important outcomes: the quality of the relationships between synchronized individuals, and how well syn­ chronized individuals perform together. Nonetheless a clear estimation of the size of the correlations between interpersonal physiological synchrony and relationship or performance outcomes is missing. To address this gap in knowledge was the main goal of the current meta-analysis. We focused on interpersonal physiological syn­ chrony in measures of autonomic nervous system activity, and specifically we examined the distinct branches of the autonomic nervous system. We conducted two meta-analyses: (1) Estimating the association between interpersonal physiological synchrony and relationship outcomes (2) Estimating the association between inter­ personal physiological synchrony and performance outcomes. In the first meta-analysis (i.e., relationships), the overall estimated correlation was small with a marginal significance (ES=0.09, p>.10) and high heterogeneity (I2=76.0%). In further sub-group analysis, we discovered a positive relationship for measures of sympathetic synchrony (ES=0.19, p=.02), a negative relationship for measures of parasympathetic synchrony(ES=-0.21, p=.03), and a positive relationship for measures of combined sympathetic and parasympathetic synchrony (ES =0.16, p=.02). As for the second meta-analysis (i.e., performance), the overall effect size of correlation was small (ES=0.26, p<.01) and heterogeneous (I2=52.7%). Our results emphasize the small effect sizes of the correlations between physiological synchrony and performance or relational outcomes, as well as the differential effects for synchrony in sympathetic versus parasympathetic activity. Combined with the high heterogeneity, our results point to the need for a rigorous a-priori scientific approach which distinguishes between different types of physiological synchrony.",

      "abstractNote": "While early research on charismatic communication focused on charismatic language and more specifically rhetoric strategies, recent studies increasingly reveal the acoustic-prosodic features of charismatic speech. Furthermore, the development of the PASCAL score provided a complex metric which assesses the charisma level of a speaker’s acoustic voice profile. While this measurement of charismatic speech is attributional and hence assesses charisma through its impact on the listener, we may ask whether speakers whose voices are perceived as charismatic embody certain charismatic personality traits. We assessed the PASCAL charisma score as well as its individual acoustic features of 30 female speakers and correlated them with the Big Five personality traits. The results suggest that charismatic speech is not correlated with a charismatic personality, which supports the hypothesis that charismatic speech constitutes a skill that needs to be learned and is largely independent of personality. However, certain personality facets may facilitate speaker charisma and are correlated with acoustic features that make up charismatic speech. Specifically, assertiveness and activity correlate with a more charismatic f0 mean, articulation rate as well as phrase duration for female speakers, while facets such as anxiety, diligence and surprisingly gregariousness seem to be detrimental to speaker charisma.",

To accomplish this, the study relates group-level video data analysis with students’ self-reported emotional experiences. The results indicate that students’ negative emotional experiences related to the task prior to collaborative working increase the group’s emotion regulation during the collaboration and that negative group interactions negatively affect students’ emotional experiences after the task. The study also shows that even though group-level regulation is more likely to change the valence of the group’s interaction from negative to positive, regulation does not always succeed in making a difference to the students’ overall emotional experiences.",

However, less is known about the whys and ways regulation is activated at a group level. This research explores what triggers 12-year-old primary school students’ (N = 37) negative socio-emotional interactions during a collaborative science task and whether the nature of the trigger makes a difference to group-level emotion regulation strategies and their sequential composition in these interactions. Groups’ collaborative working was videotaped, and triggers and strategies were analysed. The results reveal that the triggers of negative interactions are linked to the groups’ activated regulation strategies. Motivation control strategies were more represented in situations where negative interactions were triggered by task-related issues, whereas socially related triggers were associated with behavioural regulation strategies. Furthermore, the results illustrate that strategies are concatenated to a series of strategic actions, which mostly begin with sharing an awareness of the trigger. The results indicate a need to focus on the series of strategic actions activated in group interactions. This will help reveal how socially shared regulatory processes build a group’s emotional atmosphere.",

      "abstractNote": "This article takes a novel approach to understanding the phenomenon of charisma by viewing it through the frame of the aesthetic category of the sublime. It draws similarities between the account of the sublime as theorized by the Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant, and the theory of charismatic authority as rendered by Max Weber. The resulting analysis contributes insight into the phenomenon in three ways: it serves to locate the experience of charisma as a relational encounter rather than one situated solely within the leader him or herself, it highlights contextual factors which contribute to the experience of charismatic leadership, and it suggests a new way of distinguishing between generative and degenerative forms of charisma based in its relational quality rather than in outcomes associated it. The article concludes that, interpreted as an expression of the sublime, charismatic leadership functions as a means by which followers are empowered to wake up to their own sense of agency to respond in radical ways during times of crisis.",

However, there is a scarcity of formal measures that can comprehensively evaluate how well they react to the user’s emotional needs. The objective of this research is to develop and validate a set of new measures, collectively called the agent empathic reactivity index (AERI), an adaptation of the interpersonal reactivity index (IRI) developed for the human-human relationship evaluation to the human-agent interaction context. By rigorously following the measure development procedures suggested by prior research, four dimensions of AERI measures of empathic concern, perspective-taking, fantasy, and personal distress were developed. Multiple pilot tests and surveys involving various conversational agents were conducted to validate the four AERI measures. The study results show that the new measures have strong psychometric properties and nomological validity.",

Little is known about how regulating one’s own stress responses impacts teammates. In this article, we propose that individual efforts to regulate emotions can impact teammates for the better. We tested hypotheses arising from this claim using a dyadic experiment (N ϭ 266) that assessed in vivo physiological stress responses during collaborative work (a face-to-face product design task) and then individual work (a product pitch to evaluators). Throughout the experiment, the manipulated teammate was randomly assigned to reappraise their stress arousal, suppress their emotional displays, or receive no instructions. The nonmanipulated teammate received no instructions in all experimental conditions. Stress reappraisal benefited both teammates, eliciting challenge-like physiological responses (higher cardiac output, lower total peripheral resistance) relative to the suppression and control conditions. These effects were observed during both collaborative and individual work. A mediation model suggested that face-to-face interpersonal effects of stress reappraisal fed forward to promote nonmanipulated teammates’ improved stress responses during individual performance. Moreover, manipulated teammates’ displays of positive and negative affect emerged as potential mechanisms for improvements in nonmanipulated teammates’ stress responses in moderation analyses. Thus, participants benefited by interacting with a person who reappraised their stress as functional. This work has theoretical implications for the interpersonal dynamics of emotion regulation, and relevance for applied settings is also discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Occasionally, problems are solved with a sudden Aha! moment (insight), while the mundane approach to solving problems is analytical (non-insight). At first glance, non-insight appears to depend on the availability and taxation of cognitive resources to execute the step-by-step approach, whereas insight does not, or to a lesser extent. However, this remains debated. To investigate the reliance of both solution types on cognitive resources, we assessed the involvement of the prefrontal cortex using vagally mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV) as an index. Participants (N = 68) solved 70 compound remote associates word puzzles solvable with insight and non-insight. Before, during, and after solving the word puzzles, we measured the vmHRV. Our results showed that resting-state vmHRV (trait) showed a negative association with behavioural performance for both solution types. This might reflect inter-individual differences in inhibitory control. As the solution search requires one to think of remote associations, inhibitory control might hamper rather than aid this process. Furthermore, we observed, for both solution types, a vmHRV increase from resting-state to solution search (state), lingering on in the post-task recovery period. This could mark the increase of prefrontal resources to promote an open-minded stance, essential for divergent thinking, which arguably is crucial for this task. Our findings suggest that, at a general level, both solution types share common aspects. However, a closer analysis of early and late solutions and puzzle difficulty suggested that metacognitive differentiation between insight and non-insight improved with higher trait vmHRV, and that a unique association between trait vmHRV and puzzle difficulty was present for each solution type.",

      "abstractNote": "Individuals that pay attention to narrative stimuli show synchronized heart rate (HR) and electrodermal activity (EDA) responses. The degree to which this physiological synchrony occurs is related to attentional engagement. Factors that can inﬂuence attention, such as instructions, salience of the narrative stimulus and characteristics of the individual, affect physiological synchrony. The demonstrability of synchrony depends on the amount of data used in the analysis. We investigated how demonstrability of physiological synchrony varies with varying group size and stimulus duration. Thirty participants watched six 10 min movie clips while their HR and EDA were monitored using wearable sensors (Movisens EdaMove 4 and Wahoo Tickr, respectively). We calculated inter-subject correlations as a measure of synchrony. Group size and stimulus duration were varied by using data from subsets of the participants and movie clips in the analysis. We found that for HR, higher synchrony correlated signiﬁcantly with the number of answers correct for questions about the movie, conﬁrming that physiological synchrony is associated with attention. For both HR and EDA, with increasing amounts of data used, the percentage of participants with signiﬁcant synchrony increased. Importantly, we found that it did not matter how the amount of data was increased. Increasing the group size or increasing the stimulus duration led to the same results. Initial comparisons with results from other studies suggest that our results do not only apply to our speciﬁc set of stimuli and participants. All in all, the current work can act as a guideline for future research, indicating the amount of data minimally needed for robust analysis of synchrony based on inter-subject correlations.",

Based on Gray's reinforcement sensitivity theory, we expected the relationships between approach‐oriented dispositions and charisma to diminish under conditions of high workload‐induced stress. In a large‐scale lab study with 201 groups (Study 1,\n              N\n              = 721 participants), we manipulated conditions of stress and tested the interaction of stress with leaders’ extraversion and openness to experience in predicting their charismatic behaviors. We then tested, in a field study of 71 executives (Study 2,\n              N\n              = 256 participants), the interaction of employees’ reported stress with leaders’ stimulation values in predicting their charismatic behavior. In support of our hypotheses, the relationships between approach‐oriented dispositions and charisma were significantly weaker when stress was high. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of this finding, in particular given that it is in stressful conditions under which charismatic leadership is said to be most important.",

      "abstractNote": "Capturing team processes, which are highly dynamic and quickly unfold over time, requires methods that go beyond standard self-report measures. However, quantitative observational methods are challenging when teams are observed in the wild, that is, in their full-situated context. Technologically advanced tools that enable high-resolution measurements in the wild are rare and, when they exist, expensive. The present research advances highresolution measurement of team processes by introducing a technological application—the Communication Analysis Tool (CAT)—that captures fine-grained interactions in real workplace contexts. We introduce four core features of CAT: (a) customized coding measures, (b) session-based feedback on interrater reliability, (c) visualization and feedback options for displaying team dynamics, and (d) an export function to conduct advanced statistical analyses on effective team processes. We illustrate these core features using data from an organizational field project on multidisciplinary teams tasked with diagnosing patients with uncommon and highly complex medical conditions.",

However, our understanding of this complex and dynamic phenomenon is still limited. Here, we examine unimodal primitives (activity on the screen, speech, and body movements), and their multimodal combinations during remote CPS. We analyze two datasets where 116 triads collaboratively engaged in a challenging visual programming task using video conferencing software. We investigate how UI-interactions, behavioral primitives, and multimodal patterns were associated with teams’ subjective and objective performance outcomes. We found that idling with limited speech (i.e., silence or backchannel feedback only) and without movement was negatively correlated with task performance and with participants’ subjective perceptions of the collaboration. However, being silent and focused during solution execution was positively correlated with task performance. Results illustrate that in some cases, multimodal patterns improved the predictions and improved explanatory power over the unimodal primitives. We discuss how the findings can inform the design of real-time interventions for remote CPS.",

      "abstractNote": "Empathy is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that plays a crucial role in human social interactions. Recent developments in social neuroscience have provided valuable insights into the neural underpinnings and bodily mechanisms underlying empathy. This methodology often prioritizes precision, replicability, internal validity, and confound control. However, fully understanding the complexity of empathy seems unattainable by solely relying on artificial and controlled laboratory settings, while overlooking a comprehensive view of empathy through an ecological experimental approach. In this article, we propose articulating an integrative theoretical and methodological framework based on the 5E approach (the “E”s stand for\n              embodied, embedded, enacted, emotional, and extended perspectives of empathy\n              ), highlighting the relevance of studying empathy as an active interaction between embodied agents, embedded in a shared real-world environment. In addition, we illustrate how a novel multimodal approach including mobile brain and body imaging (MoBi) combined with phenomenological methods, and the implementation of interactive paradigms in a natural context, are adequate procedures to study empathy from the 5E approach. In doing so, we present the Empirical 5E approach (E5E) as an integrative scientific framework to bridge brain/body and phenomenological attributes in an interbody interactive setting. Progressing toward an E5E approach can be crucial to understanding empathy in accordance with the complexity of how it is experienced in the real world.",

      "abstractNote": "Research on charismatic leadership has been criticized for the ambiguity of its central construct. Attempts to deﬁne and measure charisma have frequently treated it as a complex construct consisting of multiple components. However, little work has been done to develop a theoretical model that oﬀers a parsimonious rationale explaining why certain leadership attributes are considered “charismatic” while others are not, or how these attributes combine to produce charismatic eﬀects. Addressing these issues, we present a model that situates emotion as the primary variable in the charismatic process. We use recent research on the moral emotions to frame a theory of followership-relevant emotions (FREs) that describes how leaders use emotions such as compassion, admiration, and anger to compel their followers to act. We then discuss the Elicit-Channel (EC) model of charismatic leadership, positing that the charismatic relationship is a ﬁve-step, cyclical process. In the EC model, leaders elicit highly motivating emotions from their followers and then channel those emotions to produce action that, if successful, results in outcomes such as positive aﬀect and trust. These outcomes then enable the leader to continue the cycle, eliciting emotion once more. We conclude by oﬀering a research agenda, addressing potential methodological concerns, and discussing future directions.",

      "abstractNote": "Emotions play a crucial role in collaboration. They help to make inferences about the partner and can strongly influence task performance. Due to limitations of emotional cues in computer-mediated collaboration (CMC), the collaborative process can be impacted. In this study, we report on the effect of an Emotion Awareness Tool (EAT) designed to facilitate the sharing of emotions between partners, on the perceived emotions after collaboration and the perceived quality of the interaction. Results showed that the EAT stimulated participants to engage in a mutual modeling of emotions. In the EAT condition, the perceived amount of time spent on emotion modeling process was positively correlated to the perceived intensity of positive emotions after collaboration. The EAT increased the perceived degree of transactivity, but only for women. This study provides a first step in exploring the effect of emotion awareness in CMC tasks including a comparing approach for its gender-specific relevance.",

Although the complexity and dynamism of personal and social phenomena have long been recognized, they are difﬁcult to investigate using traditional research methods. This article provides an overview of dynamical social psychology, an approach adapted from dynamical systems theory that is designed to capture the complementary tendencies of stability and dynamism at different levels of social reality, from private thoughts to intergroup relations. Utilizing time-series analyses and computer simulations, this perspective documents the emergence of global properties from the interaction of basic elements in mental and social systems and investigates the time-dependent relation between external inﬂuences and a system’s internally generated dynamics. The dynamical approach enables social psychology to advance as a precise science while preserving the basic insights that launched the ﬁeld over a century ago.",

      "abstractNote": "This study advanced knowledge on charisma by (a) introducing a new personality-based model to conceptualize and assess charisma and by (b) investigating curvilinear relationships between charismatic personality and leader effectiveness. Moreover, we delved deeper into this curvilinear association by (c) examining moderation by the leader’s level of adjustment and by (d) testing a process model through which the effects of charismatic personality on effectiveness are explained with a consideration of specific leader behaviors. Study 1 validated HDS charisma (Hogan Development Survey) as a useful trait-based measure of charisma. In Study 2 a sample of leaders (N ϭ 306) were assessed in the context of a 360-degree development center. In line with the too-much-of-a-good-thing effect, an inverted U-shaped relationship between charismatic personality and observer-rated leader effectiveness was found, indicating that moderate levels are better than low or high levels of charisma. Study 3 (N ϭ 287) replicated this curvilinear relationship and further illustrated the moderating role of leader adjustment, in such a way that the inflection point after which the effects of charisma turn negative occurs at higher levels of charisma when adjustment is high. Nonlinear mediation modeling further confirmed that strategic and operational leader behaviors fully mediate the curvilinear relationship. Leaders low on charisma are less effective because they lack strategic behavior; highly charismatic leaders are less effective because they lack operational behavior. In sum, this work provides insight into the dispositional nature of charisma and uncovers the processes through which and conditions under which leader charisma translates into (in)effectiveness.",

      "abstractNote": "A key emergent property of group social dynamic is synchrony–the coordination of actions, emotions, or physiological processes between group members. Despite this fact and the inherent nested structure of groups, little research has assessed physiological synchronization between group members from a multi-level perspective, thus limiting a full understanding of the dynamics between members. To address this gap of knowledge we re-analyzed a large dataset (N = 261) comprising physiological and psychological data that were collected in two laboratory studies that involved two different social group tasks. In both studies, following the group task, members reported their experience of group cohesion via questionnaires. We utilized a nonlinear analysis method-multidimensional recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis that allowed us to represent physiological synchronization in cardiological interbeat intervals between group members at the individual-level and at the group-level. We found that across studies and their conditions, the change in physiological synchrony from baseline to group interaction predicted a psychological sense of group cohesion. This result was evident both at the individual and the group levels and was not modiﬁed by the context of the interaction. The individual- and group-level effects were highly correlated. These results indicate that the relationship between synchrony and cohesion is a multilayered construct. We re-afﬁrm the role of physiological synchrony for cohesion in groups. Future studies are needed to crystallize our understanding of the differences and similarities between synchrony at the individual-level and synchrony at the group level to illuminate under which conditions one of these levels has primacy, or how they interact.",

      "abstractNote": "Empathic communication allows individuals to perceive and understand the feeling and emotion of the person with whom they are interacting. This could be particularly important during remote collaboration (such as remote assistance or distance learning) to enhance the social and emotional understanding of geographically distributed partners. However, supporting awareness in remote collaboration is very challenging especially when the interaction with the remote parties resulted in less information that can be communicated than in a physical interaction. We explore the effect of visualization using physiological cues that allow users to interpret emotional behaviors of remote parties with whom they are interacting in real time. The proposed visual representation allows users to infer emotional patterns from physiological cues that can potentially inﬂuence their communication approach toward a more aggressive style or maintain passive and peaceful interaction. We conducted a study involving participants who were paired up for a collaborative assessment task, interacting via voice only, videoconference, or a visual representation of the physiological measurements. Participants perceived the usage of our visual representation with higher group cohesiveness than using voice-only interaction. Further analysis shows that the visual representation significantly increases the positive affect score (i.e., participants are perceived to be more alert and demonstrate less distress) during remote collaboration. We discuss the possibilities of the proposed visual representation to support empathic communication during remote collaboration, and the beneﬁts to the remote partners of having positive affect and group cohesiveness.",

We claim that a good way of answering this question is to begin by observing a teaching and learning process as, where, and when it occurs. In addition, a conceptual model of intertwined learning-teaching processes is discussed, and dynamic modeling as an approach to theory formation about teaching-learning processes. The focus lies on the evolution term, the timescale of interaction processes, state space as a perspective on teacher-student interaction dynamics, and the principle of agency. Finally, an empirical approach to studying teaching-learning processes is illustrated by means of a case study, focusing on the use of cluster analyses techniques. In the Conclusion and Discussion section, further perspectives on theory building and empirical research are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent research suggests that shared behavioral dynamics during interpersonal interaction are indicative of subjective and objective outcomes of the interaction, such as feelings of rapport and success of performance. The role of shared physiological dynamics to quantify interpersonal interaction, however, has received comparatively little attention. In the present study, we investigate the coordination dynamics of multiple psychophysiological measures and their utility in capturing emotional dynamics in teams. We use data from an experiment where teams of three people built origami boats together in an assembly-line manner while their heart rate, skin conductance, and facial muscle activity were recorded. Our results show that physiological synchrony of skin conductance measures and eletromyographic measures of the corrugator supercilii develops spontaneously among team members during this cooperative production task. Moreover, high team synchrony is found indicative of team cohesion, while low team synchrony is found indicative of a teams' decision to adopt a new behavior across multiple production sessions. We conclude that team-level measures of synchrony offer new and complementary information compared to measures of individual levels of physiological activity.",

      "abstractNote": "The current research examined the interpersonal dynamics of emotion regulation in a stressful collaborative context. Little is known about how regulating one’s own stress responses impacts teammates. In this article, we propose that individual efforts to regulate emotions can impact teammates for the better. We tested hypotheses arising from this claim using a dyadic experiment (N ϭ 266) that assessed in vivo physiological stress responses during collaborative work (a face-to-face product design task) and then individual work (a product pitch to evaluators). Throughout the experiment, the manipulated teammate was randomly assigned to reappraise their stress arousal, suppress their emotional displays, or receive no instructions. The nonmanipulated teammate received no instructions in all experimental conditions. Stress reappraisal benefited both teammates, eliciting challenge-like physiological responses (higher cardiac output, lower total peripheral resistance) relative to the suppression and control conditions. These effects were observed during both collaborative and individual work. A mediation model suggested that face-to-face interpersonal effects of stress reappraisal fed forward to promote nonmanipulated teammates’ improved stress responses during individual performance. Moreover, manipulated teammates’ displays of positive and negative affect emerged as potential mechanisms for improvements in nonmanipulated teammates’ stress responses in moderation analyses. Thus, participants benefited by interacting with a person who reappraised their stress as functional. This work has theoretical implications for the interpersonal dynamics of emotion regulation, and relevance for applied settings is also discussed.",

Self and others’ emotions and their consequences are crucial in social interactions but may be overlooked during collaborative problem-solving, as group members may highly focus on the processing of task information. Therefore, some authors have suggested that collaboration can benefit from explicit mutual sharing of emotions. However, other authors also argue that the beneficial effects of emotion sharing depend on the individuals’ dispositions to use emotions to change behaviors. This study explores how these two aspects influence how group members perceive their relationship during collaborative problem-solving. Results show that people with lower dispositions to regulate emotions improve their perception of equality, receptivity and productivity when they share emotions explicitly.",

      "abstractNote": "This study explores the dynamics between socio-metacognitive communication patterns and collaborative processes, as students engage in collaborative discussions about course concepts. Building upon a series of studies that aimed to design and validate an intervention to help students develop collaborative competencies at the group level, the study aims to map how socio-metacognitive sense-making patterns are associated with the collaboration quality, by comparing the patterns for low, medium, and high performing teams. Discussion and after-discussion reflection transcripts of 12 teams over five sessions were analyzed and assessed, using previously developed collaborative discourse rubric and sensemaking coding construct. The results showed a significant correlation between frequency of sense-making acts and the quality of the collaborative discourse.",

      "abstractNote": "The role of emotions in (computer-supported) collaborative learning has become an important research topic. However, research has mainly focused on the relationships between emotions and socio-emotional processes. Despite an extensive literature on the role of emotions in cognitive processes, socio-cognitive processes have been scarcely explored at this point. This article aims to investigate, using control-value theory (Pekrun, 2006) as a frame of reference, how task-achievement appraisals impact both self-experienced emotions and the perception of socio-cognitive processes. An experimental study involving 28 pairs of participants playing a collaborative problem-solving computer puzzle game was carried out. Depending on the experimental conditions, participants received different false feedback about group task mastery and ranking aiming at skewing in different ways how they appraised task achievement. At the end of the task, they reported self and partner’s emotions as well as their perception of their socio-cognitive exchanges. The results indicate that 1) participants experienced a large variety of achievement emotions and some of them appear more closely related to specific task-achievement appraisals, 2) achievement emotions do not mediate the relationship between task-achievement appraisals and the perception of socio-cognitive processes, 3) the level of self-experienced activation as well as the perception of activation in the partner mediate the relationship between task-achievement appraisals and the perception of socio-cognitive processes and could be used as a heuristic of socio-cognitive collaborative involvement by problem solvers, 4) partner’s emotions such as gratitude appear to increase the perception of socio-cognitive processes through the reinforcement of group mastery goal.",

Synchronous interpersonal multimodal signals from 30 dyads were recorded while collaborating remotely. Features measuring how much collaborators’ eye-movements and physiology are coupled were extracted from the obtained time series and two regression models were trained to assess collaboration. Results show that the two coupling measures can be used to predict collaborative processes such as emotion management and convergence. Assessing those processes is a major step toward the development of remote collaborative interfaces able to adapt to the users’ social interactions.",

Group composition, particularly diversity and member social perceptiveness, are consistent predictors of CI, but we have limited knowledge about the mechanisms underlying their effects. To address this gap, we examine how physiological synchrony, as an indicator of coordination and rapport, relates to CI in computermediated teams, and if synchrony might serve as a mechanism explaining the effect of group composition on CI. We present results from a laboratory experiment where 60 dyads completed the Test of Collective Intelligence (TCI) together online and rated their group satisfaction, while wearing physiological sensors. We find that synchrony in facial expressions (indicative of shared experience) was associated with CI and synchrony in electrodermal activity (indicative of shared arousal) with group satisfaction. Furthermore, various forms of synchrony mediated the effect of member diversity and social perceptiveness on CI and group satisfaction. Our results have important implications for online collaborations and distributed teams.",

However, the current literature presents inconclusive findings about the way in which PS is reflected in cognitive and affective group processes and performance. In light of this, this study investigates the relationship between PS and metacognitive experiences (ie, judgement of confidence, task interest, task difficulty, mental effort and emotional valence) that are manifested during CPS. In addition, the study explores the association between PS and group performance. The participants were 77 university students who worked together on a computer-based CPS simulation in groups of three. Participants’ electrodermal activity (EDA) was recorded as they worked on the simulation and metacognitive experiences were measured with situated self-reports. A Multidimensional Recurrence Quantification Analysis was used to calculate the PS among the collaborators. The results show a positive relationship between continuous PS episodes and groups’ collective mental effort. No relationship was found between PS and judgement of confidence, task interest, task difficulty or emotional valence. The relationship between PS and group performance was also nonsignificant. The current work addresses several challenges in utilising multimodal data analytics in CPS research and discusses future research directions.",

Understanding the temporal dynamics of team processes and related team phenomena with a high-resolution lens (i.e., methods with high sampling rates) is particularly challenging when going “into the wild” (i.e., studying teams operating in their full situated context). We review quantitative field studies using high-resolution methods (e.g., video, chat/ text data, archival, wearables) and map out the various temporal lenses for studying team dynamics. We synthesize these different lenses and present an integrated temporal framework that is of help in theorizing about team dynamics. We also provide readers with a “how to” guide that summarizes four essential steps along with analytical methods (e.g., sequential and pattern analyses, mixed-methods research, abductive reasoning) that are applicable to the broad scope of high-resolution methods.",

      "abstractNote": "With the expansive growth of AI’s capabilities in recent years, researchers have been tasked with developing and improving human-centered AI collaborations, necessitating the creation of human–AI teams (HATs). However, the differences in communication styles between humans and AI often prevent human teammates from fully understanding the intent and needs of AI teammates. One core difference is that humans naturally leverage a positive emotional tone during communication to convey their confidence or lack thereof to convey doubt in their ability to complete a task. Yet, this communication strategy must be explicitly designed in order for an AI teammate to be human-centered. In this mixed-methods study, 45 participants completed a study examining how human teammates interpret the behaviors of their AI teammates when they express different positive emotions via specific words/phrases. Quantitative results show that, based on corresponding behaviors, AI teammates were able to use displays of emotion to increase trust in AI teammates and the positive mood of the human teammate. Additionally, our qualitative findings indicate that participants preferred their AI teammates to increase the intensity of their displayed emotions to help reduce the perceived risk of their AI teammate’s behavior. When taken in sum, these findings describe the relevance of AI teammates expressing intensities of emotion while performing various behavioral decisions as a continued means to provide social support to the wider team and better task performance.",

      "abstractNote": "Despite the challenges associated with virtually mediated communication, remote collaboration is a defining characteristic of online multiplayer gaming communities. Inspired by the teamwork exhibited by players in first-person shooter games, this study investigated the verbal and behavioral coordination of four-player teams playing a cooperative online video game. The game,\n              Desert Herding\n              , involved teams consisting of three\n              ground players\n              and one\n              drone operator\n              tasked to locate, corral, and contain evasive robot agents scattered across a large desert environment. Ground players could move throughout the environment, while the drone operator’s role was akin to that of a “spectator” with a bird’s-eye view, with access to veridical information of the locations of teammates and the to-be-corralled agents. Categorical recurrence quantification analysis (catRQA) was used to measure the communication dynamics of teams as they completed the task. Demands on coordination were manipulated by varying the ground players’ ability to observe the environment with the use of game “fog.” Results show that catRQA was sensitive to changes to task visibility, with reductions in task visibility reorganizing how participants conversed during the game to maintain team situation awareness. The results are discussed in the context of future work that can address how team coordination can be augmented with the inclusion of artificial agents, as synthetic teammates.",

Using Empatica E4 wristbands, electrodermal activity—to derive arousal—was measured in 24 high school students working in groups of three (i.e., triads) during two runs of an advanced physics course. The participants met three times a week over six weeks for lessons of 75 min each. Most of the time (≈60–95% of the lesson) the triad members were at diﬀerent arousal levels, and, when they were on the same level, it was mainly the low arousal (or deactivated) level. Less than 4% of the time were the triad members simultaneously in high arousal. Possible within-triad arousal contagion cases (71.3%) occurred mostly on a one-to-one basis and with a latency from within a few seconds up to 10 min, but usually within 1 min. This study supports the view that only small parts of group work are collaborative, as far as the synchronicity and coordination which collaboration presupposes. Although exploratory, results also illustrate the aﬀordances of physiological measures to characterize collaborative processes.",

Participants included 89 middle school students who watched either a positive or neutral mood video program. After students watched the video, they completed the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) scale to determine their current mood. Participants were then divided into three groups and given a divergent thinking task to complete. Group A was asked to generate potential solutions to a problem (generative thinking). Group B was given one solution to the problem that had been offered by participants’ peers in a previous pilot study and then asked to generate possible advantages to this particular solution (evaluative thinking). Group C was given the potential solution but asked to generate potential disadvantages (also evaluative thinking). Students in the positive mood condition were significantly more fluent than those who watched the neutral video. Students in the neutral mood condition generated more disadvantages than advantages, but this difference was significant only at p < .10. Implications and limitations of these results were discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Charismatic leaders have consistently been shown to affect followers' performance, motivation, and satisfaction. Yet, what precisely constitutes charisma still remains somewhat enigmatic. So far, research has mainly focused on leader traits, leader behaviors, or the leader follower-relationship, and the subsequent consequences of each on followers' self-concepts. All of these approaches share the notion that leader charisma depends on an explicit interaction between leader and follower. With the present review paper, we extend extant theorizing by arguing that charisma is additionally informed by embodied signals that ﬂow directly from either the leader or the immediate environment. We introduce the embodiment perspective on human perception and describe its utility for theoretically understanding the charismatic effect. Correspondingly, we review studies that show which concrete embodied cues can support the charismatic effect. Finally, we discuss the variety of new theoretical and practical implications that arise from this research and how they can complement existing approaches to charismatic leadership.",

Our research therefore looks at how elementary school students’ regulation skills and emotions are supported by a collaborative game using a collaboration script to scaffold group awareness. An intervention was carried out with a sample of 223 students aged between 10 and 13. The experimental group worked collaboratively in sub-groups, scaffolded by the game, while the control group attended regular lessons. The students’ attitudes towards collaboration were evaluated before and after the intervention. In addition to this, a focus group was held a week after the intervention, which involved 32 students from both groups. The quantitative analysis revealed that attitudes towards collaboration improved significantly among students in the experimental group. This difference can be explained by a combination of the intervention, the students’ initial attitudes, and their respective GPAs. The qualitative analysis provided evidence of the regulation processes and emotions that emerge when combining a collaboration script with group awareness tools during CPS activities. Furthermore, the results highlighted the relationship between these tools and positive emotions (i.e., satisfaction), co-regulation, and shared regulation. These findings suggest that there is a relationship between the coregulation process required by the game and a shift in emotions from frustration to satisfaction. This work provides evidence of how scaffolding group awareness using a collaboration script supports regulation skills and emotions, thus promoting the development of Collaborative Problem-Solving skills.",

      "abstractNote": "Charisma, the ability to attract and retain followers without beneﬁt of formal authority, is more diﬃcult to deﬁne than to identify. While we each seem able to identify charismatic individuals – and non-charismatic individuals – it is not clear what it is about an individual that inﬂuences our judgment. This paper describes the results of experiments designed to discover potential correlates of such judgments, in what speakers say and the way that they say it. We present results of two parallel experiments in which subjective judgments of charisma in spoken and in transcribed American political speech were analyzed with respect to the acoustic and prosodic (where applicable) and lexico-syntactic characteristics of the speech being assessed. While we ﬁnd that there is considerable disagreement among subjects on how the speakers of each token are ranked, we also ﬁnd that subjects appear to share a functional deﬁnition of charisma, in terms of other personal characteristics we asked them to rank speakers by. We also ﬁnd certain acoustic, prosodic, and lexico-syntactic characteristics that correlate signiﬁcantly with perceptions of charisma. Finally, by comparing the responses to spoken vs. transcribed stimuli, we attempt to distinguish between the contributions of ‘‘what is said” and ‘‘how it is said” with respect to charisma judgments.

      "abstractNote": "Purposeful behaviours of student agency are essential in collaborative learning. As agentic behaviour is based on psychological mechanisms, it is also reflected in a person’s inner, psychophysiological arousal. As agency is a relational process, physiological synchrony (mutual shifts in physiology) may provide unique insights into the role of agency in collaborative learning. This research uses two approaches to understand the continuous connection between physiological synchrony and agency behaviours. We use skin conductivity to measure physiological arousal both in reaction to context (phasic) and the level of intensity (tonic). As a novel parallel measure, we use coding of agency behaviours as a quantitative measurement to understand collaborative group work of four students during one lesson. Signal similarity analysis of a maximum time lag series (MTLC) by dynamic time warping (DTW) revealed moments of intense collaboration. The results indicate that students’ agency is reflected in physiological synchrony. During collaborative group work, the students displayed high physiological synchrony, with students’ tonic electrodermal activity (EDA) correlated with agency behaviours. The benefits of analysing skin conductivity and video analysis of agency behaviour together further the interpretation of physiological synchrony during social processes. Both physiological reactions and contemporary interpersonal analyses display a symbiotic relationship worthy of further investigation.",

Healthy volunteers (n = 106) completed a 240-item Big Five personality inventory, the state/ Trait Anxiety inventory, and a ten minute electrocardiographic recording. Time and frequency domain estimates of HRV were derived from the cardiac time series and related to the Big Five dimensions of personality, to personality types extracted from a cluster analysis, and to Trait Anxiety. Frequency domain measures of HRV (HRV-HF, LF/HF) were associated with speciﬁc dimensions of personality, but signiﬁcance was not noted for the time domain measure (STD-RR). Furthermore, distressed personality types exhibited signiﬁcantly greater autonomic imbalance (LF/HF) than other personality types. However, signiﬁcance was not noted for the time domain measure (STD-RR). These results can be explained with reference to a contemporary model of neurovisceral integration. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Religious, societal, and organizational phases in the conceptualization of charisma are identified. The mutability of charisma has extended charismatic leadership theory from the domain of theology to multiple facets of the organizational sciences. Shifting conceptualizations of charisma that emphasize different elements have facilitated the study of leader traits, leader behaviors, situational contingencies, leader and organizational communications, and organizational cultures. These pluralistic conceptualizations of leadership and charisma have broadened our understanding of charismatic leadership. Yet, we must acknowledge that the breadth of knowledge we have gained has been at the expense of a more profound understanding of any one particular conceptualization of charisma.",

      "abstractNote": "This article seeks to demonstrate that implicit within Weber’s writings on charisma are tools that can enable a processual, social constructionist understanding of charismatic formation. A corollary of this point is that Weber’s writings represent an historically crucial turning point in the progression from a Carlylian idea of leaders as inherently powerful to a non-essentialist, sociological perspective, and that Weber’s inspiration for this progression is best understood not through reference to his nineteenth-century forbearers in the social sciences, but rather in his contrast with the very few theological writers (namely Rudolph Sohm and the writers of the New Testament) who actually had employed charisma as a term prior to Weber’s famous appropriation of it. A reinterpretation and retranslation of Weber’s writings on charisma that gives priority to the social constructionist elements in his thought can provide tools for navigating through many of the interpretational controversies that have plagued charisma research.",

      "abstractNote": "The aim of this paper is to introduce our current research design to study socially shared regulation processes in a science classroom where a collaborative learning design is implemented. The design is based on a self-regulated learning framework that provides opportunities and support for self-initiated regulation among individual learners and collaborative groups. It utilizes modern technology to structure and support regulated learning in the groups. The paper focuses on elaborating the research design, particularly from the perspective of motivation and emotion, by presenting the dual relationship between designing learning scenario that supports learners’ motivation and emotion regulation with technology and researching the multifaceted role of motivation and emotion as they occur in collaborative learning. To do this, the paper ﬁrst describes the entire collaborative learning design while paying attention to how technology can be utilized to support the awareness of motivation, emotion, and their regulation. Then, the focus shifts to considering the methodological principles and implementation of multimodal data gathered in relation to authentic collaborative learning tasks. A case example from a secondary school science classroom demonstrates possibilities for multimodal data use in analyzing motivation, emotion, and their regulation in collaborative learning. It also illustrates the dual role of the implemented technological 6Q support tool by showing how data collected from the students’ use of the tool can be utilized in scientiﬁc analysis. The paper concludes by providing a short discussion about the current advancements of emerging technology in motivation and emotion research in the learning sciences highlighting the signiﬁcance of sharing the theoretical premises of the research design as well as practical experiences from implementation of these designs for future research.",

      "abstractNote": "As we identify with characters on screen, we simulate their emotions and thoughts. This is accompanied by physiological changes such as galvanic skin response (GSR), an indicator for emotional arousal, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), referring to vagal activity. We investigated whether the presence of a cinema audience affects these psychophysiological processes. The study was conducted in a real cinema in Berlin. Participants came twice to watch previously rated emotional film scenes eliciting amusement, anger, tenderness or fear. Once they watched the scenes alone, once in a group. We tested whether the vagal modulation in response to the mere presence of others influences explicit (reported) and implicit markers (RSA, heart rate (HR) and GSR) of emotional processes in function of solitary or collective enjoyment of movie scenes. On the physiological level, we found a mediating effect of vagal flexibility to the mere presence of others. Individuals showing a high baseline difference (alone vs. social) prior to the presentation of film, maintained higher RSA in the alone compared to the social condition. The opposite pattern emerged for low baseline difference individuals. Emotional arousal as reflected in GSR was significantly more pronounced during scenes eliciting anger independent of the social condition. On the behavioural level, we found evidence for emotion-specific effects on reported empathy, emotional intensity and Theory of Mind. Furthermore, people who decrease their RSA in response to others’ company are those who felt themselves more empathically engaged with the characters. Our data speaks in favour of a specific role of vagal regulation in response to the mere presence of others in terms of explicit empathic engagement with characters during shared filmic experience.",

It takes as a premise that a necessary prerequisite for organizing, or “protoorganizing,” occurs through emotional contagion in subpopulations of human interaction dynamics in complex ecosystems. Emotional contagion is posited to engender emotional understanding and identification with others, a social process that acts as a mechanism that enables (or precludes) cooperative responses to opportunities and risks. Propositions are offered and further research is suggested.",

The study had three objectives: 1) to identify the constructs of collaboration, 2) to develop a collaboration scale, and 3) to validate the collaboration scale. The study included 363 9th-grade students, and after an extensive literature review, it identified four constructs of collaboration: social interdependence, conflict resolution, cooperation, and sharing of resources. The consistency between these constructs was found to be positive. The scale reliability was established with a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.768 and a test-retest reliability coefficient of 0.71. The content validity of the scale was also established with a Cohen kappa coefficient of 0.66. The study found that differences between boys and girls can be determined by obtaining standard scores on the collaboration scale. This new collaboration scale will be a useful tool for practitioners who use constructivist pedagogy to measure collaboration.",

      "abstractNote": "Team coordination consists of both the dynamics of team member interaction and the environmental dynamics to which a team is subjected. Focusing on dynamics, an approach is developed that contrasts with traditional aggregate-static concepts of team coordination as characterized by the shared mental model approach. A team coordination order parameter was developed to capture momentary fluctuations in coordination. Team coordination was observed in three-person uninhabited air vehicle teams across two experimental sessions. The dynamics of the order parameter were observed under changes of a team familiarity control parameter. Team members returned for the second session to either the same (Intact) or different (Mixed) team. “Roadblock” perturbations, or novel changes in the task environment, were introduced in order to probe the stability of team coordination. Nonlinear dynamic methods revealed differences that a traditional approach did not: Intact and Mixed team coordination dynamics looked very different; Mixed teams were more stable than Intact teams and explored the space of solutions without the need for correction. Stability was positively correlated with the number of roadblock perturbations that were overcome successfully. The novel and non-intuitive contribution of a dynamical analysis was that Mixed teams, who did not have a long history working together, were more adaptive. Team coordination dynamics carries new implications for traditional problems such as training adaptive teams.",

      "abstractNote": "Objective: A method for detecting real-time changes in team cognition in the form of significant communication reorganizations is described. We demonstrate the method in the context of scenario-based simulation training.\nBackground: We present the dynamical view that individual- and team-level aspects of team cognition are temporally intertwined in a team’s real-time response to challenging events. We suggest that this real-time response represents a fundamental team cognitive skill regarding the rapidity and appropriateness of the response, and methods and metrics are needed to track this skill.\nMethod: Communication data from medical teams (Study 1) and submarine crews (Study 2) were analyzed for significant communication reorganization in response to training events. Mutual information between team members informed post hoc filtering to identify which team members contributed to reorganization.\nResults: Significant communication reorganizations corresponding to challenging training events were detected for all teams. Less experienced teams tended to show delayed and sometimes ineffective responses that more experienced teams did not. Mutual information and post hoc filtering identified the individual-level inputs driving reorganization and potential mechanisms (e.g., leadership emergence, role restructuring) underlying reorganization.\nConclusion: The ability of teams to rapidly and effectively reorganize coordination patterns as the situation demands is a team cognitive skill that can be measured and tracked.",

      "abstractNote": "Recently, AI is integrating into teams to collaborate with humans as a teammate with the goal of achieving unprecedented team outcomes. Much of the coordination between humans and AI teammates relies on human-AI communication, which is challenging due to AI's limitations on natural language communication. Thus, it is essential to identify and develop effective communication strategies for AI teammates in human-AI teams to facilitate the coordination process. Through interviews with 60 participants who collaborated with an AI teammate in a multiplayer online game, in this paper, we explore communication strategies that humans expect AI teammates to apply to support human-AI coordination and collaboration in dyadic teaming environments, and how the AI teammate's communication can impact teaming processes. Our findings highlight four communication strategies AI teammates should apply to support their coordination with humans in dyadic teaming environments. We also find that AI teammates' proactive communication with humans could facilitate the development of human trust and situation awareness, whereas AI lacking such proactive communication is often not perceived as a teammate. Our study extends the current CSCW/HCI research on human-AI communication in teaming environments by shedding light on how communication should be structured in dyadic human-AI teams for effective and smooth collaboration.",

      "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Interpersonal synchrony contributes to social functioning in dyads, but it remains unknown how synchrony shapes group experiences and performance. To this end, we designed a novel group drumming task in which participants matched their drumming to either predictable or unpredictable tempos. Fifty-one three-person groups were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: synchronized or asynchronized drumming. Outcome measures included electrocardiograms and self-reports of group cohesion and synchrony. The drumming task elicited an increase in physiological synchrony between group members (specifically their hearts’ interbeat intervals). We also found that physiological synchronization and behavioral synchronization predicted individuals’ experience of group cohesion. Physiological synchrony also predicted performance in a subsequent group task that involved freely drumming together. The findings suggest that the behavioral and physiological consequences of synchronization contribute to the formation of group bonds and coordination. They also confirm that insights from translational social neuroscience can inform our knowledge of the development of cohesive and efficacious groups.",

      "abstractNote": "Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is a cyclical process in which team members go back and forth between various cognitive and affective phases as they interact with the problem state and each other. An increasing amount of research has been conducted to explore how sequential relationships between the CPS phases affect team performance outcomes. However, detecting CPS phases mainly relies on labor-intensive methods, such as video coding of all team interactions during the problem-solving process. Furthermore, it is challenging to un­ derstand the level of sharedness or togetherness among the team members when they go through a specific CPS phase. Consequently, this study aimed to investigate shared physiological arousal events (SPAE) in CPS. We developed and implemented a new method for detecting SPAEs during CPS by utilizing skin conductance response data. Our findings showed that SPAE can be a promising method for detecting the cognitive and socioemotional CPS phases that are demonstrated as increasing physiological arousal among the team members. Process-mining analysis of the SPAEs revealed different sequential pathways among the successful and less successful teams both in terms of the CPS phases and the problem variables they address during SPAEs. The current study contributes to the timely agenda of CPS and collaborative learning fields in developing multimodal methods to unearth complex team interaction processes during collaboration.",

      "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Cooperation is pivotal for society to flourish. To foster cooperation, humans express and read intentions via explicit signals and subtle reflections of arousal visible in the face. Evidence is accumulating that humans synchronize these nonverbal expressions and the physiological mechanisms underlying them, potentially influencing cooperation. The current study is designed to verify this putative linkage between synchrony and cooperation. To that end, 152 participants played the Prisoner’s Dilemma game in a dyadic interaction setting, sometimes facing each other and sometimes not. Results showed that synchrony in both heart rate and skin conductance level emerged during face-to-face contact. However, only synchrony in skin conductance levels predicted cooperative success of dyads. Crucially, this positive linkage was strengthened when participants could see each other. These findings show the strong relationship between our bodily responses and social behavior, and emphasize the importance of studying social processes\n              between\n              rather than within individuals in real-life interactions.",

Based on this assumption, this paper investigated (1) how emotions between the interlocutors are synchronized during a dialog and (2) what types of behavioral or physiological reactions correlate with each other. Speaker’s verbal and non-verbal emotional behavior (vocal/facial) and physiological responses (heart rate/skin conductance) were recorded when they engaged in competitive/cooperative tasks. After recording, the speakers annotated their own and their interlocutor’s emotional states (arousal/valence/positivity). An analysis of variance test with correlation coefﬁcients between emotional states suggested that male speakers were less emotionally synchronized than female speakers in the competitive dialog. It also suggested that they believed that their emotions would have been more synchronized with each other than they actually were. Moreover, the results of the correlation tests revealed that the behavioral or physiological reactions of most of the pairs in the same dialog were positively correlated.",

      "abstractNote": "Electrodermal activity is characterized by the superposition of what appear to be single distinct skin conductance responses (SCRs). Classic trough-to-peak analysis of these responses is impeded by their apparent superposition. A deconvolution approach is proposed, which separates SC data into continuous signals of tonic and phasic activity. The resulting phasic activity shows a zero baseline, and overlapping SCRs are represented by predominantly distinct, compact impulses showing an average duration of less than 2 s. A time integration of the continuous measure of phasic activity is proposed as a straightforward indicator of event-related sympathetic activity. The quality and beneﬁt of the proposed measure is demonstrated in an experiment with short interstimulus intervals as well as by means of a simulation study. The advances compared to previous decomposition methods are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Occasionally, problems are solved with a sudden Aha! moment (insight), while the mundane approach to solving problems is analytical (non-insight). At first glance, non-insight appears to depend on the availability and taxation of cognitive resources to execute the step-by-step approach, whereas insight does not, or to a lesser extent. However, this remains debated. To investigate the reliance of both solution types on cognitive resources, we assessed the involvement of the prefrontal cortex using vagally mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV) as an index. Participants (N = 68) solved 70 compound remote associates word puzzles solvable with insight and non-insight. Before, during, and after solving the word puzzles, we measured the vmHRV. Our results showed that resting-state vmHRV (trait) showed a negative association with behavioural performance for both solution types. This might reflect inter-individual differences in inhibitory control. As the solution search requires one to think of remote associations, inhibitory control might hamper rather than aid this process. Furthermore, we observed, for both solution types, a vmHRV increase from resting-state to solution search (state), lingering on in the post-task recovery period. This could mark the increase of prefrontal resources to promote an open-minded stance, essential for divergent thinking, which arguably is crucial for this task. Our findings suggest that, at a general level, both solution types share common aspects. However, a closer analysis of early and late solutions and puzzle difficulty suggested that metacognitive differentiation between insight and non-insight improved with higher trait vmHRV, and that a unique association between trait vmHRV and puzzle difficulty was present for each solution type.",

These three studies suggest that measuring how much communicative inﬂuence teammates have on the teams’ collaborative behavior may predict both team outcomes and team members’ perceptions of their teamwork. Importantly, interpretations of inﬂuence were sensitive to the context with different patterns emerging from a lab study with college students compared to middle school classrooms. Further, unlike static measures that are aggregated across an entire collaboration session, inﬂuence dynamics can change over the course of a team’s time together, making inﬂuence a useful real-time and summary measure at the individual and the team level. Feedback from middle school teachers suggests that being able to visualize a measure of inﬂuence in their classrooms could enable them to attend to multiple student groups in a busy classroom and check their own perceptions of how student groups are collaborating.",

      "abstractNote": "Joint Visual Attention (JVA) has long been considered a critical component of successful collaborations, enabling coordination and construction of a shared knowledge space. However, recent studies challenge the notion that JVA alone ensures efective collaboration. To gain deeper insights into JVA’s infuence, we examine nonlinear gaze coupling and gaze regularity in the collaborators’ visual attention. Specifcally, we analyze gaze data from 19 dyadic and triadic teams engaged in a co-located programming task using Recurrence Quantifcation Analysis (RQA). Our results emphasize the signifcance of team-level gaze regularity for improving task performance - highlighting the importance of maintaining stable or sustained episodes of joint or individual attention, than disjointed patterns. Additionally, through regression analyses, we examine the predictive capacity of recurrence metrics for subjective traits such as social cohesion and social loafng, revealing unique interpersonal and team dynamics behind productive collaborations. We elaborate on our fndings via qualitative anecdotes and discuss their implications in shaping real-time interventions for optimizing collaborative success.",

      "abstractNote": "Interpersonal autonomic physiology is defined as the relationship between people’s physiological dynamics, as indexed by continuous measures of the autonomic nervous system. Findings from this field of study indicate that physiological activity between two or more people can become associated or interdependent, often referred to as physiological synchrony. Physiological synchrony has been found in both new and established relationships across a range of contexts, and it correlates with a number of psychosocial constructs. Given these findings, interpersonal physiological interactions are theorized to be ubiquitous social processes that co-occur with observable behavior. However, this scientific literature is fragmented, making it difficult to evaluate consistency across reports. In an effort to facilitate more standardized scholarly approaches, this systematic review provides a description of existing work in the area and highlights theoretical, methodological, and statistical issues to be addressed in future interpersonal autonomic physiology research.",

The variability of SCR shapes hereby complicates the proper decomposition of SC data. A method is proposed for full decomposition of SC data into tonic and phasic components. A twocompartment diffusion model was found to adequately describe a standard SCR shape based on the process of sweat diffusion. Nonnegative deconvolution is used to decompose SC data into discrete compact responses and at the same time assess deviations from the standard SCR shape, which could be ascribed to the additional process of pore opening. Based on the result of single non-overlapped SCRs, response parameters can be estimated precisely as shown in a paradigm with varying inter-stimulus intervals.",

Classic trough-to-peak analysis of these responses is impeded by their apparent superposition. A deconvolution approach is proposed, which separates SC data into continuous signals of tonic and phasic activity. The resulting phasic activity shows a zero baseline, and overlapping SCRs are represented by predominantly distinct, compact impulses showing an average duration of less than 2 s. A time integration of the continuous measure of phasic activity is proposed as a straightforward indicator of event-related sympathetic activity. The quality and beneﬁt of the proposed measure is demonstrated in an experiment with short interstimulus intervals as well as by means of a simulation study. The advances compared to previous decomposition methods are discussed.",

Due to this rising importance, it has become essential to understand the interpersonal dynamism between humans and AI to further optimise their performance potential. Given the demonstrated utility of emotional communication within human-human team structures, this research investigates the nature of AI-sourced positive emotions on human teammates. Through 47 interviews, our ﬁndings show that for these AI teammates to be accepted, human teammates have preferences on understanding the emotional utility prior to its presentation, as well as which emotions are situationally acceptable. Also, ﬁndings show that integrating emotions within AI teammates has a positive inﬂuence on human perceptions and behaviour in a task. In further detail, emotions act as status updates that allow human teammates to not only better understand their teammates’ mental states but also understand how their AI teammates perceive the situation around them. Together, this gives insight into how AI emotional expressions inﬂuence the perception of social support on the wider Human-AI team. Mainly how emotions can be used to increase acceptance of AI teammates and improve the overall experience human teammates have within the task.",

      "abstractNote": "Although research on collaborative learning suggests that monitoring plays an important role in successful regulation of the collaborative learning process, little is known about how students attend to it together. This study explores monitoring in collaborative learning. Speciﬁcally, it studies how students in a group monitor their cognitive, aﬀective and behavioral processes during their collaboration, as well as how observed monitoring cooccurs with their physiological synchrony during the collaborative learning session. Data was collected from 48 Finnish highschool students who were learning about nutrition in groups of three. The session was videotaped and coded in terms of monitoring of cognition, behavior and aﬀect. Students’ arousal was measured as electrodermal activity with wearable sensors and used to calculate physiological synchrony between the students. Three case groups, with priority on the quality of the data, were chosen for detailed analysis. The results indicate that the main targets of monitoring for these case groups were cognition and behavior, while monitoring of aﬀect occurred the least. Most of the student pairs inside the groups showed signiﬁcant amounts of physiological synchrony. High values of physiological synchrony occurred when monitoring was frequent. Time series analysis showed a weak positive connection between monitoring and physiological synchrony for two groups out of three. These results indicate that physiological synchrony could potentially shine a light on the joint regulation processes of collaborative learning groups.",

      "abstractNote": "Dyadic gaming experience was studied in a psychophysiological experiment where conflict structure and the presence of an artificial intelligence (AI) agent in a turnbased game were varied in four different conditions. Electrocardiographic and electrodermal activity signals of 41 same-gender dyads were recorded to study joint changes in their physiological signals. A strong physiological linkage was found within dyads in all conditions, but the linkage scores did not differentiate between conflict modes. The only significant difference in linkage between conditions was an increase when the AI agents were not present. In addition, linkage was associated with different self-report scales assessing social presence. These results suggest that social presence and physiological linkage within dyads are higher when dyads can focus on each others’ actions without distractions.",

      "abstractNote": "The culture trap is the tendency to put cultural markers and habits above the demands of reason or compassion. It can reduce receptivity to new ideas and trigger Phoenix Cycles of catastrophe and renaissance. System research is then complicated by the historiographic problem of continuity and change, because there are no objective criteria for deciding whether \"the system\" survived or was destroyed by the catastrophe. This paper explores the differences between uncertainty emergence and self-organizing emergence using the concept of a \"possibility space\" to clarify the relationship between anti-causal events and causal states, i.e., the meso-history of conjuncture. Conjunctures are interpreted ex post in the context of deep time. The paper distinguishes autopoiesis, i.e., a new instance of a species, from elaboration, i.e., the origin of new species. It also describes a spectrum ranging from metastability, in which the possibility space is time invariant, to innovation, in which the possibility space is a synergetic artefact of changing habits and beliefs. Metastable systems are computably complex; we can make predictions across the boundaries of successive conjunctures, subject to statistical uncertainties. Innovative systems are uncomputably complex; although we can make predictions within a conjuncture and anticipate bottlenecks, we cannot predict beyond the conjuncture because conceptual taxonomies will not be conserved. The relationship between adaptive potential and constraint remains fundamental, although debates about whether the system is resilient are meaningless. System boundaries are artefacts of a dynamic consensus. The analytical sciences use methods designed for metastable systems, whereas the discursive sciences presume innovation. These methods predispose researchers to different space-time perspectives that, in turn, make it possible to generalize about their roles in different policy arenas. Tensions between analytical and discursive scientists become more understandable and manageable if these historiographic issues are clarified. The relationship between innovation and metastability is illustrated in an appendix on the emergence of social complexity in Europe.",

      "abstractNote": "We live in troubling times. Amongst global political instability, rising economic inequality and a rapacious Western consumerist lifestyle, we face the impending risks of global warming and ecological collapse. In this short opinion paper, we bring this topic to the agenda of ecological psychology in the hope of stimulating fruitful conversation. To do so, we ask how ecological psychologists should conceptualize the environment in these precarious times. We will argue that the current ecological catastrophe shows that the environment should not be described simply in terms of affordances, but as an ecosystem on which many affordances depend. Not only does this conceptualization hold scientific implications, it speaks to an active morality that could help us change our ways, and play our part in holding open a just future for all.",

      "abstractNote": "Ecological dynamics characterizes adaptive behavior as an emergent, self-organizing property of interpersonal interactions in complex social systems. The authors conceptualize and investigate constraints on dynamics of decisions and actions in the multiagent system of team sports. They studied coadaptive interpersonal dynamics in rugby union to model potential control parameter and collective variable relations in attacker–defender dyads. A videogrammetry analysis revealed how some agents generated ﬂuctuations by adapting displacement velocity to create phase transitions and destabilize dyadic subsystems near the try line. Agent interpersonal dynamics exhibited characteristics of chaotic attractors and informational constraints of rugby union boxed dyadic systems into a low dimensional attractor. Data suggests that decisions and actions of agents in sports teams may be characterized as emergent, self-organizing properties, governed by laws of dynamical systems at the ecological scale. Further research needs to generalize this conceptual model of adaptive behavior in performance to other multiagent populations.",

A formalized version of this hypothesis was tested by examining the phase adjustments in both limbs in response to mechanical perturbation of the bimanual coordination pattern and during frequencyinduced phase transitions, for both right- and left-handed participants. In both situations, the phase adaptations were made predominantly by the non-dominant limb in right-handers, whereas this eﬀect failed to reach signiﬁcance in left-handers. Thus, the asymmetry in coupling strength was less pronounced in the latter group. In addition, the degree of asymmetry depended on movement frequency. The observed asymmetry was discussed in relation to pertinent neurophysiological ﬁndings. Ó 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "abstractNote": "Expert musicians show experience-dependent reduced asymmetry in the structure of motor-related brain areas and in the maximum tapping frequency between the hands. Therefore we hypothesized that a reduced hand-skill asymmetry is strongly related to rapid and rhythmical bimanual coordination and developed a dynamical model including a symmetry-breaking parameter Δω, for human bimanual coordination. We conducted unimanual and bimanual drumming experiments to test the following model predictions. 1) The asymmetry in the maximum tapping frequency is more pronounced in nondrummers than that in drummers. If so, 2) a larger number of phase wanderings (i.e., succession of taps by the same hand), 3) larger SD of the relative phase between the hands ( SD ϕ), and 4) larger deviation of mean relative phase (mean ϕ) from 180° would be observed in nondrummers than that in professional drummers during antiphase bimanual drumming at the maximum speed. In a unimanual tapping task, the asymmetry in maximum tapping frequency of nondrummers was more pronounced than that of professional drummers. In a bimanual coordination task, phase wanderings were observed only in nondrummers and SD ϕ of the nondrummers is significantly larger than that of professional drummers. On the other hand, there was no significant difference between the mean ϕ of the two groups. All these observations were successfully reproduced by changing Δω, which corresponded to the asymmetry in the maximum tapping frequency. These results support the hypothesis indicating that the prominent bimanual coordination pattern emerges spontaneously after a nonspecific change in Δω or symmetry restoration of the nonlinear dynamical systems.",

      "abstractNote": "Niels Bohr’s maxim contraria sunt complementa indicated his strong suspicion that the complementarity interpretation of quantum mechanics might someday be expanded into a generalized principle. It now appears that such a principle has been found in metastability which appears at the scale of living things. Metastability has been proposed as a principle of brain~behavior, and is captured in the extended or ‘broken-symmetry’ version of the HKB model of coordination dynamics. The metastable regime of coordination dynamics reconciles the tendency of specialized brain regions to express autonomy (segregation) and their simultaneous tendency to work together as a synergetic whole (integration). There is growing evidence from recent studies in the brain and behavioral sciences that the complementary nature of integrating and segregating tendencies is essential to the way human brain~minds work.",

Here, we present a generalized variance method for multivariate detrended fluctuation analysis (mvDFA). The advantage of this extension is that it can be applied to multivariate time series and considers intercorrelation between these time series when estimating fractal properties. First, we briefly describe how fractal fluctuations have advanced a dynamic system understanding of cognition. Then, we describe mvDFA in detail and highlight some of the advantages of the approach for simulated data. Furthermore, we show how mvDFA can be used to investigate empirical multivariate data using electroencephalographic recordings during a time‐estimation task. We discuss this methodological development within the framework of interaction‐dominant dynamics. Moreover, we outline how the availability of multivariate analyses can inform theoretical developments in the area of dynamic systems in human behavior.\n          , \n            Human behavior exhibits complex dynamics and is multidimensional. To investigate human behavior from a dynamic systems perspective, multivariate methods are needed that extract relevant parameters that can be used to link such human data to properties of dynamic systems. Here, we present an extension of multivariate fractal analysis to further such research.",

In different conditions the availability of second screen text chat (communicative expression) and visualization of group level physiological heart rates and their dyadic linkage (physiology) was varied. Within this four person group two participants formed a physically co-located dyad and the other two were individually situated in two separate rooms. We found that text chat always increased heart rate synchrony but HR visualization only with non-co-located dyads. We also found that physiological linkage was strongly connected to self-reported social presence. The results encourage further exploration of the possibilities of sharing group member’s physiological components of emotion by technological means to enhance mediated communication and strengthen social presence.",

      "abstractNote": "Physiological synchrony within a dyad, or the degree of temporal correspondence between two individuals’ physiological systems, has become a focal area of psychological research. Multiple methods have been used for measuring and modeling physiological synchrony. Each method extracts and analyzes different types of physiological synchrony, where ‘type’ refers to a specific manner through which two different physiological signals may correlate. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no documentation of the different methods, how each method corresponds to a specific type of synchrony, and the statistical assumptions embedded within each method. Hence, this article outlines several approaches for measuring and modeling physiological synchrony, connects each type of synchrony to a specific method, and identifies the assumptions that need to be satisfied for each method to appropriately extract each type of synchrony. Furthermore, this article demonstrates how to test for between-dyad differences of synchrony via inclusion of dyad-level (i.e., time-invariant) covariates. Finally, we complement each method with an empirical demonstration, as well as online supplemental material that contains Mplus code.",

      "abstractNote": "Synchrony at the physiological level is an objective measure that can be used to investigate cooperation between human agents. This physiological synchrony has been experimentally observed in different dyadic contexts through measures of the autonomous system such as cardiac measures. Various metrics are used to characterize synchrony between participants such as crosscorrelation, weighted coherence, or cross recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis and with a wide variety of paradigms. We propose the delayed coincidence count as a new method for assessing cardiac synchrony. Delayed coincidence count has already been used to characterize synchrony in ﬁring neurons populations. While being straightforward and computationally light, this method has already been formally proven to be statistically robust. A complex dynamic microworld is designed with two difﬁculty levels and two cooperation conditions. A total of 40 participants, i.e., 20 teams, voluntarily has conducted the experiment. The delayed coincidence count method (with a coincidence threshold δ of 20 ms) reveals a signiﬁcant synchrony (p < .01) during the cooperative and high difﬁculty condition only, while the other methods did not. The results are interpreted in terms of interaction intensity in accordance with recent literature.",

      "abstractNote": "Social interactions are pervasive in human life with varying forms of interpersonal coordination emerging and spanning different modalities (e.g. behaviors, speech/language, and neurophysiology). However, during social interactions, as in any dynamical system, patterns of coordination form and dissipate at different scales. Historically, researchers have used aggregate measures to capture coordination over time. While those measures (e.g. mean relative phase, cross-correlation, coherence) have provided a wealth of information about coordination in social settings, some evidence suggests that multiscale coordination may change over the time course of a typical empirical observation. To address this gap, we demonstrate an underutilized method, windowed multiscale synchrony, that moves beyond quantifying aggregate measures of coordination by focusing on how the relative strength of coordination changes over time and the scales that comprise social interaction. This method involves using a wavelet transform to decompose time series into component frequencies (i.e. scales), preserving temporal information and then quantifying phase synchronization at each of these scales. We apply this method to both simulated and empirical interpersonal physiological and neuromechanical data. We anticipate that demonstrating this method will stimulate new insights on the mechanisms and functions of synchrony in interpersonal contexts using neurophysiological and behavioral measures.",

      "abstractNote": "The phenomenon of physiological linkage describes similar fluctuations of two individuals' physiology, for example, the cardiac inter-b­ eat interval (IBI). Physiological linkage is a well-­documented occurrence in research settings of interacting dyads but the literature on non-i­nteracting dyads, that is, someone watching a video of another person, is sparse. The current study investigated whether physiological linkage, based on IBI, occurs from watching videos where strangers report about personal (neutral, positive, negative non-t­raumatic, and negative traumatic) experiences. Videos were produced with six individuals and then presented to observers (N =  26). Time-­frequency-­domain cross-­wavelet analyses supplemented by threshold-­free cluster enhancement (TFCE; to account for multiple testing) showed significant physiological linkage between the IBI of observers and persons in the videos for 16 out of the 21 tested videos. Although significant physiological linkage also emerged for neutral videos and positive, negative valence videos led to such associations more reliably. This study shows that physiological linkage can be investigated in highly controlled conditions based on video stimuli paving the path for experimental manipulation in future research. Furthermore, due to the provision of information on time and frequency, the use of cross-w­ avelet analysis is encouraged to learn more about factors modulating physiological linkage. The current study presents the next step toward identifying psychophysiological causal and modulating factors of physiological linkage.",

      "abstractNote": "Abstract\n          Team coordination breakdowns (TCBs) generally reflect episodes of ineffective team functioning, resulting in suboptimal team performance. Computational identification of TCBs enables us to examine the underlying characteristics of suboptimal performance, and to potentially deliver real-time feedback to teams. Especially in time-critical crisis situations, such feedback can be invaluable. Previous studies found difficulties in distinguishing between coordination patterns that indicate TCBs, and patterns that might indicate other aspects of teamwork. Subsequently, we examined features capturing underlying characteristics of team coordination, based on multiple physiological signals and coordination measures, to identify TCBs. Our multi-methodological approach allowed us to identify features that are important for TCB identification. We also observed that distributions of feature data related and unrelated to TCBs were significantly different, indicating that the features captured underlying patterns in team coordination data. In addition, our results indicated that team performance, measured as goal achievement duration, is more severely compromised when TCBs last longer. By showing a relationship between TCBs and goal achievement duration, as well as understanding the key features of these TCBs, our study contributes to deepening our understanding of TCBs, and supporting effective team functioning and performance.",

In Experiment 1, left-handed and right-handed participants (N = 36) repeatedly used one hand for grasping a small cube. After a clear switch in the cube’s location, perseverative limb selection was revealed in both handedness groups. In Experiment 2, the cubes were presented in a clockwise and counterclockwise sequence to right-handed participants (N = 15). A spatial shift in the switch point between right-hand use and left-hand use was observed. The model simulates the experiments by implementing the nonlinear multiple-timescale dynamics of the action-selection process underlying limb selection. It integrates two mechanisms that were earlier proposed to underlie this selection aspect of manual activity: limb dominance and attentional information. Finally, the model is used to simulate an inﬂuential earlier experiment, by establishing a conceptual link between cross-lateral inhibition asymmetry and the direction and strength of handedness.",

A formalized version of this hypothesis was tested by examining the phase adjustments in both limbs in response to mechanical perturbation of the bimanual coordination pattern and during frequencyinduced phase transitions, for both right- and left-handed participants. In both situations, the phase adaptations were made predominantly by the non-dominant limb in right-handers, whereas this eﬀect failed to reach signiﬁcance in left-handers. Thus, the asymmetry in coupling strength was less pronounced in the latter group. In addition, the degree of asymmetry depended on movement frequency. The observed asymmetry was discussed in relation to pertinent neurophysiological ﬁndings. Ó 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "abstractNote": "Handedness and attentional asymmetries in bimanual rhythmic coordination were examined as a function of movement speed. In an in-phase 1:1 frequency locking task, left-handed and right-handed subjects controlled the oscillations of either the right or the left hand so as to contact spatial targets. The task was performed at three frequencies of coupled movement. Coordination dynamics incorporating the body's functional asymmetry predicted that left-handers and right-handers would deviate from zero relative phase in opposite directions, that the deviation would be greater for preferred-hand targeting, and that this deviation would be greater at higher movement frequencies. The results confirmed the major predictions and suggested that asymmetry due to handedness is magnified by attention.",

      "abstractNote": "This chapter addresses the role of afferent feedback and reflexes in the regulation of interlimb coordination in animals and humans with a focus on locomotion. From the work on cats it is known that the rhythmic muscle activities during gait are generated by specialized neural circuits located in the spinal cord (the so-called central pattern generator, \"CPGs\"). These CPGs are coordinated by neurons, which interconnect both sides or which transmit information between the cervical and lumbar spine. It is argued that afferent input, especially load-related information, plays a major role in shaping the resulting coordination of these CPGs. Induced changes are seen not only with a general loading of the animal but also with the selective loading of a given limb. Such principles also apply to human locomotion. Studies on infants have shown that basic coordination patterns exist, very similar to those found in the cat. The effects of afferents (notably those related to load and to hip position) play an important role in phase transitions, much as was described in feline la models. In adults, the role of proprioceptive afferents was studied by muscle vibration (selective stimulus for afferents) and by adding load (activating mainly Ib afferents). When applied during gait, tendon vibration has little effect on intra - and interlimb coordination. In contrast, load manipulations produce more profound changes. During gait, the loading of one of the limbs induces adaptations in inter-limb coordination in the 3 remaining limbs, thereby providing rhythm constancy (stable cadence). This is in line with other evidence indicating that the coordination between arm and leg movements is quite robust across various types of locomotion, suggesting a strong coupling between both homologous and non-homologous limbs.",

      "abstractNote": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare hand selection and accuracy of technical skills between lowand high-pressure games of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in the 2018–2019 regular season and playoffs.\nMethod: A notational analysis was conducted on 24 games of four teams (12 low-pressure games and 12 highpressure games, six of each team, three in each condition). One- or two-handed actions were recorded for dribbling, passing, catching, and shooting (layups, dunks, hooks, and tips) skills.\nResults: During high-pressure games, players significantly increased the frequency of right-handed passing. Highpressure games also increased the frequency of left-handed catching. For dribbling and shooting, no differences were observed in hand frequency between conditions. The success rate of all analyzed skills was similar between the hands in both low- and high-pressure conditions.\nConclusion: Our results showed that game pressure could selectively modulate hand preference for passing and catching skills in elite-level basketball while presenting no significant effect on performance between hands.",

      "abstractNote": "A classical view is that motor learning has distinguishable early, intermediate, and late phases. A recent view is that motor learning is the acquisition of an abstract equation of motion that specifies the time evolution of a pattern of coordination. The pattern is expressed by a collective variable that enslaves or orders component subsystems that, in turn, act on and generate the collective variable. In these latter terms, early learning resolves the collective variable and its motion equation, intermediate learning stabilizes and standardizes the subsystems or active degrees of freedom (DFs) producing the collective variable’s dynamics. The preceding ideas, and the phase-space reconstruction methods required to determine active DFs, are developed in tutorial fashion in the context of an experimental investigation of learning a bimanual rhythmic coordination. Results show that intermediate learning reduces the dimensionality of the learned coordination’s dynamics and renders those dynamics more deterministic. The tutorial development relates the preceding concepts, results and methods of analyses to (a) the contrast between PoincarCan and Newtonian dynamics, (b) contemporary interpretations of random processes, (c) definitions of DFs in respect to Bernstein’s problem, (d) the potential contribution of chaos to the adaptability of a learned coordination, and (e) possible links bctween active (dynamical) DFs and the control variables Y, c, and jr identified by the i hypothcsis. 0 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",

      "abstractNote": "Hemispheric specialization for motor control inﬂuences how individuals perform and adapt to goal-directed movements. In contrast to adaptation, motor skill learning involves a process wherein one learns to synthesize novel movement capabilities in absence of perturbation such that they are performed with greater accuracy, consistency and efﬁciency. Here, we investigated manual asymmetry in acquisition and retention of a complex motor skill that requires speed and accuracy for optimal performance in right-handed and lefthanded individuals. We further determined if degree of handedness inﬂuences motor skill learning. Ten right-handed (RH) and 10 left-handed (LH) adults practiced two distinct motor skills with their dominant or nondominant arms during separate sessions two–four weeks apart. Learning was quantiﬁed by changes in the speed–accuracy tradeoff function measured at baseline and one-day retention. Manual asymmetry was evident in the RH group but not the LH group. RH group demonstrated signiﬁcantly greater skill improvement for their dominant-right hand than their nondominant-left hand. In contrast, for the LH group, both dominant and nondominant hands demonstrated comparable learning. Less strongly-LH individuals (lower EHI scores) exhibited more learning of their dominant hand. These results suggest that while hemispheric specialization inﬂuences motor skill learning, these effects may be inﬂuenced by handedness.",

Ten right-handed adults were required to reproduce eight series of 84 ellipses on a graphic tablet at spontaneous speed. The ellipses displayed seven eccentricities, corresponding to the Lissajous plot produced by two orthogonal harmonic oscillators whose relative phase (RP) varied from 0° (a line) to 90° (a circle), and twelve orientations, the long axis of the ellipses aligned in a direction ranging from three to nine o’clock with respect to the body transverse plane. Results conﬁrmed the participant’s preference for two eccentricities, 0° and 45°, that is, a line and an ellipse of intermediate eccentricity, respectively. Except for the circle, insensitive to orientation by definition, orientation became a cogent constraint: In the 10:30 o’clock direction, line drawing (0° RP) increased in variability and the intermediate ellipse (45° RP) was attracted towards a circle (90° RP). These ﬁndings suggest an interaction between orientation effects, putatively due to differences in the motion of the wrist and ﬁngers, and eccentricity effects, which may pertain to preferences arising from the non-linear coupling between the effectors.",

However, the degree of the right-left difference in grip strength or speed difference did not correlate with the asymmetry in skill-learning rate. Therefore, although the preferred hand exhibits a better skill-learning capacity than the nonpreferred hand, asymmetry in skill learning cannot be explained by motor strength or speed.\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that better skill performance of the right hand in right-handers cannot be attributed to the degree of hand preference score, strength, or motor speed.

      "abstractNote": "Using an approach that combines experimental studies of bimanual movements to visual stimuli and theoretical modeling, the present paper develops a dynamical account of sensorimotor learning, that is, how new skills are acquired and old ones modiﬁed. A signiﬁcant aspect of our approach is the focus on the individual learner as the basic unit of analysis, in particular the quantiﬁcation of predispositions and capabilities that the individual learner brings to the learning environment. Such predispositions constitute the learner’s behavioral repertoire, captured here theoretically as a dynamical landscape (“intrinsic dynamics”). The learning process is demonstrated to not only lead to a relatively permanent improvement of performance in the required task—the usual outcome—but also to alter the individual’s entire repertoire. Changes in the dynamical landscape due to learning are shown to result from two basic mechanisms or “routes”: bifurcation and shift. Which mechanism is selected depends the initial individual repertoire before new learning begins. Both bifurcation and shift mechanisms are accommodated by a dynamical model, a relatively straightforward development of the well-established HKB model of movement coordination. Model simulations show that although environmental or task demands may be met equally well using either mechanism, the bifurcation route results in greater stabilization of the to-be-learned behavior. Thus, stability not (or not only) error is demonstrated to be the basis of selection, both of a new pattern of behavior and the path (smooth shift versus abrupt qualitative change) that learning takes. In line with these results, recent neurophysiological evidence indicates that stability is a relevant feature around which brain activity is organized while an individual performs a coordination task. Finally, we explore the consequences of the dynamical approach to learning for theories of biological change.",

      "abstractNote": "Two experiments and a dynamic model forhuman limb selection are reported. In Experiment 1, left-handed and right-handed participants (N = 36) repeatedly used one hand for grasping a small cube. After a clear switch in the cube’s location, perseverative limb selection was revealed in both handedness groups. In Experiment 2, the cubes were presented in a clockwise and counterclockwise sequence to right-handed participants (N = 15). A spatial shift in the switch point between right-hand use and left-hand use was observed. The model simulates the experiments by implementing the nonlinear multiple-timescale dynamics of the action-selection process underlying limb selection. It integrates two mechanisms that were earlier proposed to underlie this selection aspect of manual activity: limb dominance and attentional information. Finally, the model is used to simulate an inﬂuential earlier experiment, by establishing a conceptual link between cross-lateral inhibition asymmetry and the direction and strength of handedness.",

This hypothesis was supported for both right-handed and left-handed participants who performed voluntary switches from in-phase to antiphase coordination and vice versa, at four different frequencies. In accordance with previous indications that handedness is expressed less consistently in left-handers, the asymmetry between the hands was less pronounced in left-handed than in right-handed participants. The asymmetry was smaller for switches from in-phase to antiphase coordination (i.e., in the direction opposite to spontaneous transitions) than for switches in the reverse direction, suggesting that (the expression of) the handedness-related asymmetry in coupling strength was weakened by intentional processes associated with these switches.",

      "abstractNote": "Measurement instruments assessing multiple emotions during epistemic activities are largely lacking. We describe the construction and validation of the EpistemicallyRelated Emotion Scales, which measure surprise, curiosity, enjoyment, confusion, anxiety, frustration, and boredom occurring during epistemic cognitive activities. The instrument was tested in a multinational study of emotions during learning from conﬂicting texts (N = 438 university students from the United States, Canada, and Germany). The ﬁndings document the reliability, internal validity, and external validity of the instrument. A seven-factor model best ﬁt the data, suggesting that epistemically-related emotions should be conceptualised in terms of discrete emotion categories, and the scales showed metric invariance across the North American and German samples. Furthermore, emotion scores changed over time as a function of conﬂicting task information and related signiﬁcantly to perceived task value and use of cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies.",

Through an experimental design, this research examines the role that empathy and related psychological constructs may play in the experiences of designers working at a distance. Findings show that in fact empathy does matter, and may affect both the enjoyment of the experience and the efficiency with which the designers work. This study shows a link between empathy and empathic constructs, and the outcomes of computer mediated distance design collaborations.",

      "abstractNote": "Empathy is considered a crucial construct within HCI and CSCW, yet our understanding of this complex concept remains fragmented and lacks consensus in existing research. In this scoping review of 121 articles from the ACM Digital Library, we synthesize the diverse perspectives on empathy and scrutinize its current conceptualization and operationalization. In particular, we examine the various interpretations and definitions of empathy, its applications, and the methodologies, findings, and trends in the field. Our analysis reveals a lack of consensus on the definitions and theoretical underpinnings of empathy, with interpretations ranging from understanding the experiences of others to an affective response to the other’s situation. We observed that despite the variety of methods used to gauge empathy, the predominant approach remains self-assessed instruments, highlighting the lack of novel and rigorously established and validated measures and methods to capture the multifaceted manifestations of empathy. Furthermore, our analysis shows that previous studies have used a variety of approaches to elicit empathy, such as experiential methods and situational awareness. These approaches have demonstrated that shared stressful experiences promote community support and relief, while situational awareness promotes empathy through increased helping behavior. Finally, we discuss a) the potential and drawbacks of leveraging empathy to shape interactions and guide design practices, b) the need to find a balance between the collective focus of empathy and the (existing and dominant) focus on the individual, and c) the careful testing of empathic designs and technologies with real-world applications.

      "abstractNote": "It is uncontroversial to claim that cognitive science studies many complex phenomena. What is less acknowledged are the contradictions among many traditional commitments of its investigative approaches and the nature of cognitive systems. Consider, for example, methodological tensions that arise due to the fact that like most natural systems, cognitive systems are nonlinear; and yet, traditionally cognitive science has relied on linear statistical data analyses. Cognitive science as complexity science is offered as an interdisciplinary framework for the investigation of cognition that can dissolve such contradictions and tensions. Here, cognition is treated as exhibiting the following four key features: emergence, nonlinearity, self-organization, and universality. This framework integrates concepts, methods, and theories from such disciplines as systems theory, nonlinear dynamical systems theory, and synergetics. By adopting this approach, the cognitive sciences benefit from a common set of practices to investigate, explain, and understand cognition in its varied and complex forms.",

This target article attempts to articulate and support the dynamical hypothesis. The dynamical hypothesis has two major components: the nature hypothesis (cognitive agents are dynamical systems) and the knowledge hypothesis (cognitive agents can be understood dynamically). A wide range of objections to this hypothesis can be rebutted. The conclusion is that cognitive systems may well be dynamical systems, and only sustained empirical research in cognitive science will determine the extent to which that is true.",

      "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Over the past three decades, Van Gelder's dynamical hypothesis has been instrumental in reconceptualizing the ways in which perception‐action‐cognition unfolds over time and in context. Here, I examine how the dynamical approach has enriched the theoretical understanding of social dynamics within cognitive science, with a particular focus on\n              interpersonal coordination\n              . I frame this review around seven principles in dynamical systems: three that are well‐represented in interpersonal coordination research to date (\n              emergent behavior, context‐sensitive behavior\n              , and\n              attractors\n              ) and four that could be useful opportunities for future growth (\n              hysteresis, sensitivity to initial conditions, equifinality\n              , and\n              reciprocal compensation\n              ). In addition to identifying specific promising lines of theoretical inquiry, I focus on the significant potential afforded by computationally intensive science—especially in naturally occurring data or trace data. Building on the foundation laid over the past three decades, I argue that looking to increasingly situated and naturalistic settings (and data) is not only necessary to realize the\n              full\n              commitment to the dynamical hypothesis but is also critical to building parsimonious and principled theories of social phenomena.\n            \n          , \n            The dynamical approach has been transformative to the study of social behavior, especially for research on interpersonal coordination. This paper reviews advances in the dynamical approach and suggests new areas for future inquiry.",

Van Orden et al. presented evidence that “purposive behavior originates in selforganized criticality” (p. 333). Here, the authors show that Van Orden et al.’s analyses do not test their hypotheses. Further, the authors argue that a confirmation of Van Orden et al.’s hypotheses would not have constituted firm evidence in support of their framework. Finally, the absence of a specific model for how self-organized criticality produces the observed behavior makes it very difficult to derive testable predictions. The authors conclude that the proposed paradigm shift is presently unwarranted.",

Finally, we consider whether and how the notion of a developmental homology can help us understand the relationships between the cognitive functions that develop out of shared neural supports. ß 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This article questions the utility of assuming modularity, as it examines a paradigmatic double dissociation of reading modules. Reading modules illustrate two general problems. First, modularity fails to converge on a ﬁxed set of exclusionary criteria that deﬁne pure cases. As a consequence, competing modular theories force perennial quests for purer cases, which simply perpetuates growth in the list of exclusionary criteria. The ﬁrst problem leads, in part, to the second problem. Modularity fails to converge on a ﬁxed set of pure cases. The second failure perpetuates unending fractionation into more modules. © 2001 Cognitive Science Society, Inc. All rights reserved.",

The purpose of this paper is to fill in the gaps in these arguments, and in so doing show that at least one form of anti-representationalism is potentially viable. After giving a teleological definition of representation and applying it to a few models that have inspired anti-representationalist claims, I argue that anti-representationalism must be divided into two distinct theses, one ontological, one epistemological. Given the assumptions that define the debate, I give reason to think that the ontological thesis is false. I then argue that the epistemological thesis might, in the end, turn out to be true, despite a potentially serious difficulty. Along the way, there will be a brief detour to discuss a controversy from early twentieth century physics.",

      "abstractNote": "Over the last decades or so, empirical studies of perception, action, learning, and development have revealed that participants vary in what variable they detect and often rely on nonspecifying variables. This casts doubt on the Gibsonian conception of information as speciﬁcation. It is argued that a recent ecological conception of information has solved important problems, but insufﬁciently explains what determines the object of perception. Drawing on recent work on developmental systems, we sketch the outlines of an alternative conception of perceptual information. It is argued that perceptual information does not reside in the ambient arrays; rather, perceptual information is a relational property of patterns in the array and perceptual processes. What a pattern in the ambient ﬂow informs about depends on the perceiver who uses it. We explore the implications of this alternative conception of information for the ecological approach to perception and action.",

Group differences were examined in a cross-sectional design across the age range when fluency is posed to shift from word-level to text-level. One hundred five bilingual children from primary grades 3, 4, and 5 were assessed for English word reading and decoding fluency, phonological awareness, rapid symbol naming, and oral language proficiency with standardized measures. These skills were correlated with their silent reading fluency on a self-paced story reading task. Text fluency was quantified using non-linear analytic methods: recurrence quantification and fractal analyses. Findings indicate that more fluent text reading appeared by grade 4, similar to monolingual findings, and that different aspects of fluency characterized passage reading performance at different grade levels. Text fluency and oral language proficiency emerged as significant predictors of reading comprehension.",

      "abstractNote": "In 1988, the cognitive revolution had become institutionalized: Cognition was the manipulation of abstract symbols by rules. But, much like institutionalized political parties, some of the ideas were becoming stale. Where was action? Where was the self? How could cognition be smoothly integrated with emotions, with social psychology, with development, with clinical analyses? Around that time, thinkers in linguistics, philosophy, artificial intelligence, biology, and psychology were formulating the idea that just as overt behavior depends on the specifics of the body in action, so might cognition depend on the body. Here we characterize (some would say caricature) the strengths and weaknesses of cognitive psychology of that era, and then we describe what has come to be called embodied cognition: how cognition arises through the dynamic interplay of brain controlling bodily action controlling perception, which changes the brain. We focus on the importance of action and how action shapes perception, the self, and language. Having the body in action as a central consideration for theories of cognition promises, we believe, to help unify psychology.",

Young readers may not consistently \"index,\" or map, words to the objects the words represent. Consequently, these readers fail to derive much meaning from the text. The instructional method involves manipulating toy objects referred to in the text (e.g., a barn, a tractor, a horse, in a text about a farm) to simulate the actions described in the text. Correctly manipulating the objects forces indexing and facilitates the derivation of meaning. Both actual manipulation and imagined manipulation resulted in markedly better (compared with rereading) memory for and comprehension of the text material, thereby lending strong support to the Indexical Hypothesis.

      "abstractNote": "Explaining how the cognitive system can create new structures has been a major challenge for cognitive science. Self-organization from the theory of nonlinear dynamics offers an account of this remarkable phenomenon. Two studies provide an initial test of the hypothesis that the emergence of new cognitive structure follows the same universal principles as emergence in other domains (e.g., fluids, lasers). In both studies, participants initially solved gear-system problems by manually tracing the force across a system of gears. Subsequently, they discovered that the gears form an alternating sequence, thereby demonstrating a new cognitive structure. In both studies, dynamical analyses of action during problem solving predicted the spontaneous emergence of the new cognitive structure. Study 1 showed that a peak in entropy, followed by negentropy, key indicators of self-organization, predicted discovery of alternation. Study 2 replicated these effects, and showed that increasing environmental entropy accelerated discovery, a classic prediction from dynamics. Additional analyses based on the relationship between phase transitions and power-law behavior provide converging evidence. The studies provide an initial demonstration of the emergence of cognitive structure through self-organization.",

Evidence of scaling in various domains of biology may be more generally understood to reﬂect multiplicative interactions weaving together many disparate scales. The selfsimilarity of power-law scaling entails homogeneity: ﬂuctuations distribute themselves similarly across many spatial and temporal scales. However, this apparent homogeneity can be misleading, especially as it spans more scales. Reducing biological processes to one powerlaw relationship neglects rich cascade dynamics. We review recent research into multifractality in executive-function cognitive tasks and propose that scaling reﬂects not criticality but instead interactions across multiple scales and among ﬂuctuations of multiple sizes.",

      "abstractNote": "Biological and psychological processes routinely break ergodicity, meaning they fail to have stable means (𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛) and independent variation over time that we might find in additive white Gaussian noise (awGn). One possible reason for this failure of ergodicity is the failure of biological and psychological processes to exhibit independence across time. Multifractal evidence has long suggested that biological and psychological processes show strong signatures of nonlinear interactions across scales. These cross-scale interactions sooner befit a cascadedynamical process than awGn. The present work thus compares awGn to simulations of multiplicative binomial cascades, submitting both types of series and shuffled versions of each to the Thirumalai-Mountain method for estimating ergodicity breaking. Estimating ergodicity breaking for original awGn and cascade series allows us to examine the sources of ergodicity breaking across the sequence, e.g., in temporal correlations specifying nonlinear interactions across scales, and examining ergodicity breaking of the shuffled series allows us to assess the raw, sequence-independent contribution of distributional properties (e.g., the heavy tails of a cascade) without the original temporal sequence. Raw cascade fluctuations and the standard deviation (𝑆𝐷) and root mean square (𝑅𝑀𝑆) series describing those raw fluctuations break ergodicity, but nonlinear, cascade-dynamical descriptors: multifractal spectrum width (Δ𝛼) and multifractal nonlinearity (𝑡𝑀𝐹 ), maintain ergodicity. Interestingly, the fundamentally linear descriptor, fractal Hurst exponent (𝐻𝑓𝐺𝑛) shows moderate ergodicity breaking when describing the fundamentally nonlinear cascade processes, but the linear descriptor coefficient of variation (𝐶𝑉 ) controls for multiplicative relationships between 𝑆𝐷 and 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛 and maintains ergodicity. We conclude that the ergodicity of statistical descriptors depends on how well they can portray nonlinearity (Δ𝛼 and 𝑡𝑀𝐹 ) or at least multiplicativity (𝐶𝑉 ) of the underlying cascade processes.",

      "abstractNote": "This article addresses the still popular but incorrect idea that monofractal (sometimes called “fractal” for short) structure might be a deﬁnitive signature of nonlinearity and, as a corollary, that monofractal analyses are nonlinear analyses. That this point (i.e., “fractal D nonlinear”) is incorrect remains novel to many readers. We suspect that unfamiliarity with autocorrelation has helped eclipse the linearity of fractal structure from more popular appreciation. In this article, in order to explain the linear nature of monofractality and its difference from multifractality, we present an introduction to the autocorrelation function and review short-lag memory, nonstationary motions, and the intermediary set of fractionally integrated processes that conventional fractal analyses quantify. Understanding from our own experiences how surprising the linearity of fractals is to accept, we attempt to make our points clear with as much graphic depiction as math. We hope to share our own experiences in struggling with this potentially strangesounding idea that, really, monofractals are linear while at the same time contrasting them to multifractals that can indicate nonlinearity.",

In the current experiment, we extend this approach to executive function, a construct used to describe flexible, goal-oriented behavior. Participants were asked to perform a widely used executive function task, card sorting, under two conditions. In one condition, participants were given a rule with which to sort the cards. In the other condition, participants had to induce the rule from experimenter feedback. The motion of each participant's hand was tracked during the sorting task. Detrended fluctuation analysis was performed on the inter-point time series using a windowing strategy to capture changes over each trial. For participants in the induction condition, the Hurst exponent sharply increased and then decreased. The Hurst exponents for the explicit condition did not show this pattern. Our results suggest that executive function may be understood in terms of changes in stability that arise from interaction-dominant dynamics.",

This concurrent mixed methods study examined the relationship of reading motivation and self-efficacy with respect to reading achievement for N=487 grade 5-8 suburban middle school level students. All participants completed the Motivation for Reading Questionnaire (MRQ), the Reader Self Perception Scale 2 (RSPS2), and the AIMSWeb curriculum-based measurement instrument. In addition, N=4 content expert interviews were conducted. Quantitative and qualitative findings indicated that the construct of reading self-efficacy Observation (Henk & Melnick, 1995), was the most important predictor of reading achievement (p<.001). Implications for further research are included.",

Researchers have recently identified these emotions and the emotion trajectories in reading, tutoring, and problem solving. The primary learning‐centered emotions are boredom, frustration, confusion, flow (engagement), delight, surprise, and anxiety. Emotion transitions occur when the text becomes too difficult or easy for the reader and when conceptual obstacles create cognitive disequilibrium. Teachers and computer environments have the potential to improve reading comprehension by detecting and strategically handling the readers’ boredom, frustration, and confusion. One frontier in reading research is to understand the complex dance between comprehension and emotions.",

Although a large number of prior studies have investigated the relationship between emotion and reading, those studies have concentrated primarily on relatively static and distal measures of emotion. In this research, we measured 7th- and 8th-grade students’ (n ϭ 44) emotional responses more proximally: during the reading tasks themselves. To do this, we used a cardiovascular indicator, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), that has been used frequently in psychophysiological studies of emotion but not, to our knowledge, in studies of reading. Results showed that the pattern of physiological response during reading predicted reading comprehension performance. Students with the most successful reading comprehension performance showed an initial orienting physiological response, followed by a lower threat physiological state when actually starting to read. Verbal retelling performance related strongly to emotional responses during reading, but multiple-choice performance was not related.",

I first discuss the findings from the eight studies reported in this special issue. The studies represent pivotal advances in research on reading. Focusing on learning from science texts, they show that different emotions and different types of text influence reading in different ways. Furthermore, they document how the interplay of emotions, text features, and reading processes impacts knowledge acquisition, con­ ceptual change, and attitude change. I then outline core directions for future research. We need to (a) expand current theories to adequately explain the multiple links between emotions, cognitive processes, and motivational processes during reading; (b) use causal designs to disentangle the causeeffect relations linking these processes to antecedents and outcomes, includ­ ing reciprocal causation; (c) complement between-person designs with intraindividual analysis; (d) use dynamic measurement and multichannel indica­ tors to capture emotional processes; and (e) investigate the generalizability of current findings across diverse groups of learners and sociocultural contexts.",

If the concept of personality at the team level is to be taken seriously, we argue that a consistent theoretical orientation is necessary to synthesize past findings and guide future research. To fill this need, we discuss the definition, function, structure, and emergence of team personality, culminating in the development of a dynamic multilevel model linking individual team member personalities to team personality. This model is the basis through which we describe the development, path dependence, and impact of team personality. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our model.",

PeopleÕs thoughts, feelings, and predispositions for action are inherently dynamic, displaying constant change due to internal mechanisms and external forces, but over time the ﬂow of thought and action converges on a narrow range of states—a ﬁxed-point attractor—that provides cognitive, aﬀective, and behavioral stability. An attractor for personal dynamics develops through two mechanisms: the synchronization of individualsÕ internal states in social interaction, and the self-organization of thoughts and feelings with respect to a higher-order property (e.g., goal, self-concept). We present formal models of both processes and instantiate each in computer simulations. Discussion centers on the implications of interpersonal synchronization and self-organization dynamics for issues in personality psychology, including shared vs. non-shared environmental inﬂuences on personality development, the expression of personality in social interaction, personal stability vs. change, personal vs. situational causation, and the emergence of self-concept.",

By drawing on the principles of dynamic systems theory, we present Personality Dynamics model – a novel framework that captures people's typical pattern of changes in personality states using three model parameters: baseline personality, reﬂecting the stable set point around which one's states ﬂuctuate, personality variability, or the extent to which one's personality states ﬂuctuate across time and situations, and personality attractor force, pertaining to the swiftness with which deviations of one's baseline are pulled back to the baseline. We argue that the dynamic approach to personality represented in the PersDyn model has the potential to integrate diﬀerent perspectives on individual diﬀerences. We also demonstrate that the dynamic approach to personality oﬀers a consensual paradigm of personality with the potential to advance our understanding and knowledge of individual diﬀerences, by detailing the factors and processes included in the model, as well as links to existing theories and applications in various research lines.",

Body motion dynamics were extracted from videos using a frame-by-frame differentiation method. Recurrence Quantification Analysis derived the measures of Determinism, Entropy, Laminarity, and Mean-Line. Multilevel models estimated personality (IPIP-NEO-120) and situational effects. Neuroticism predicted lower determinism and fluctuating dynamics in bodily perception and socioemotional life; less complexity and stability during socioemotional topics, and increased negative affect. Extraversion predicted regular/deterministic dynamics during bodily perception. Conscientiousness predicted lower determinism and increased variability. Agreeableness predicted lower post-task negative affect. Findings are discussed within embodied, enactive, complex systems, and personality frameworks.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper, we analyze empirical data, accounting for coordination processes between complex systems (bimanual coordination, interpersonal coordination, and synchronization with a fractal metronome), by using a recently proposed method: detrended crosscorrelation analysis (DCCA). This work is motivated by the strong anticipation hypothesis, which supposes that coordination between complex systems is not achieved on the basis of local adaptations (i.e., correction, predictions), but results from a more global matching of complexity properties. Indeed, recent experiments have evidenced a very close correlation between the scaling properties of the series produced by two coordinated systems, despite a quite weak local synchronization. We hypothesized that strong anticipation should result in the presence of long-range cross-correlations between the series produced by the two systems. Results allow a detailed analysis of the effects of coordination on the fluctuations of the series produced by the two systems. In the long term, series tend to present similar scaling properties, with clear evidence of long-range cross-correlation. Short-term results strongly depend on the nature of the task. Simulation studies allow disentangling the respective effects of noise and short-term coupling processes on DCCA results, and suggest that the matching of long-term fluctuations could be the result of short-term coupling processes.",

PeopleÕs thoughts, feelings, and predispositions for action are inherently dynamic, displaying constant change due to internal mechanisms and external forces, but over time the ﬂow of thought and action converges on a narrow range of states—a ﬁxed-point attractor—that provides cognitive, aﬀective, and behavioral stability. An attractor for personal dynamics develops through two mechanisms: the synchronization of individualsÕ internal states in social interaction, and the self-organization of thoughts and feelings with respect to a higher-order property (e.g., goal, self-concept). We present formal models of both processes and instantiate each in computer simulations. Discussion centers on the implications of interpersonal synchronization and self-organization dynamics for issues in personality psychology, including shared vs. non-shared environmental inﬂuences on personality development, the expression of personality in social interaction, personal stability vs. change, personal vs. situational causation, and the emergence of self-concept.",

By drawing on the principles of dynamic systems theory, we present Personality Dynamics model – a novel framework that captures people's typical pattern of changes in personality states using three model parameters: baseline personality, reﬂecting the stable set point around which one's states ﬂuctuate, personality variability, or the extent to which one's personality states ﬂuctuate across time and situations, and personality attractor force, pertaining to the swiftness with which deviations of one's baseline are pulled back to the baseline. We argue that the dynamic approach to personality represented in the PersDyn model has the potential to integrate diﬀerent perspectives on individual diﬀerences. We also demonstrate that the dynamic approach to personality oﬀers a consensual paradigm of personality with the potential to advance our understanding and knowledge of individual diﬀerences, by detailing the factors and processes included in the model, as well as links to existing theories and applications in various research lines.",

Body motion dynamics were extracted from videos using a frame-by-frame differentiation method. Recurrence Quantification Analysis derived the measures of Determinism, Entropy, Laminarity, and Mean-Line. Multilevel models estimated personality (IPIP-NEO-120) and situational effects. Neuroticism predicted lower determinism and fluctuating dynamics in bodily perception and socioemotional life; less complexity and stability during socioemotional topics, and increased negative affect. Extraversion predicted regular/deterministic dynamics during bodily perception. Conscientiousness predicted lower determinism and increased variability. Agreeableness predicted lower post-task negative affect. Findings are discussed within embodied, enactive, complex systems, and personality frameworks.",

      "abstractNote": "Team dynamics and personality play an essential role in the success of construction projects. Construction project teams comprise professionals working together to design, detail, and construct a project. Team dynamics impact the collaboration and interaction of these project teams. How and why some teams \"click\" better than others, can be described by the strength of their collective personality. In this ongoing study, we conducted a literature review to explore the relationship between team personality and team dynamics and examine how to derive group-level personality measures from individual member inputs. Our review recognized the existence of a strong relationship between team personality and team dynamics. Although previous research on team composition has examined the impact of individual team member personalities on their team functioning, only a few studies have inspected collective team personality and its effect on team dynamics. While some efforts have been made to derive overall team personalities from the mean or variance of individual team member personalities, the results are somewhat inconsistent. There is still less conclusive evidence showing how to determine group-level personalities. Our review also noted that the construction sector has not fully incorporated personality traits as team-level constructs in design and construction project teams. The combined personality of all team members, including the owner, architect, engineer, contractor, key subcontractors, and other subject matter experts lacks full integration into construction research. Implications and recommendations are presented at the end of this paper.",
