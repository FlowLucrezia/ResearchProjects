# The nonlinearity of pupil diameter fluctuations in an insight task as criteria for detecting children who solve the problem from those who do not (2023)

why is pupillary dilation generally so patterned/deterministic compared to other ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô human behaviors/functions?

go back over method section! well written description of RQA and data processing

in adaptation or learning in a paradigm to achieve ‚Äúinsight‚Äù‚Ä¶ dissipation of entropy (decrease complexity) taking place BEFORE cognitive phenomenon of insight

action‚Ä¶ then perception (but not necessarily causal)

quasi deterministic exploration of parameter/attractor space, generating and developing attractors

what causes the switch to exploiting possible solutions? what leads to the patterned behavior that emerges PRIOR to recognition (even if implicit) of underlying pattern (of solution states)

what causes a system to reduce DoF / to reduce number of attractor states / to exploit the possible states previously explored

self organization of environment and agent gives rise to affordances that inherently constrain the optimal solution states

does ‚Äòthe body‚Äô find it first? is intuition primarily physical and secondarily cognitive?

why is pupillary dilation generally so patterned/deterministic compared to other ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô human behaviors/functions?
