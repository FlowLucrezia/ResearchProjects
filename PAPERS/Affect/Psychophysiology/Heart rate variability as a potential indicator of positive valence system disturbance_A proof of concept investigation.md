### Physiological Data

> The Zephyr™ BioHarness™ device (Zephyr Technology, Auckland, New Zealand) is a wireless physiological monitoring system used to collect ambulatory psychophysiological data (e.g., Hailstone & Kilding, 2011). Physiological data were continuously measured at 250 Hz during the entire study period, and a timestamp on the physiological data enabled the synchronization of physiological data with the onset of the different sampling event periods. Data were analyzed offline using a combination of AcqKnowledge v3.9 (Biopac Systems, Inc, Gahanna, OH) and MindWare software (MindWare Technologies, Inc., Gahanna, OH) described below. Artifacts and recording errors were corrected offline and values more or less than 3.0 standard deviations were deemed outliers and Winsorized (reassigned a value at the next highest or lowest value that was not an outlier). All values reflect means and standard deviation scores obtained collected four times each day in 40 minute bins (to ensure sufficient HRV-HF sampling intervals) centered around each of the 24 distinct sampling periods (i.e., four times each day for six consecutive days) when self-report ratings were obtained (cf. Gruber et al., 2013a, 2013b). Specifically, each bin was comprised of several smaller 5-minute bins which were subsequently averaged and aggregated into the larger 40-minute bin.

> The primary measure of focus was HRV-HF as a psychophysiological indicator of parasympathetic nervous system activity. However, we also report findings for four other comparison measures of peripheral autonomic activity – general cardiac activity (heart rate [HR] and respiratory frequency [RESP]), sympathetic nervous system activity (skin temperature [SKT]), and gross somatic movement (GSM) – to rule out motionrelated confounds (given the ambulatory nature of assessments for the study). To further ensure the specificity of our hypothesized results with respect to variability in HRV-HF, mean levels of HRV-HF were also controlled where appropriate (see below). For both our primary variables of interest, parameters of HRV-HF (i.e., HRV-Hfmean and HRVHFSD), and the four comparison measures, we computed scores consisting of the mean (i.e., average across the 24 distinct sampling periods or bins) and intra-individual standard deviation (i.e., withinperson standard deviation across the same sampling periods).

### Heart Rate

> Heart rate is influenced by both sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system and was assessed as a general index of cardiovascular activity. R-wave interval estimates in milliseconds from the ECG signal were obtained using AcqKnowledge v3.9. Inter-beat interval (IBI) values were derived from this as the time between successive R-peaks of the ECG in milliseconds. IBI values were subsequently processed in MindWare HRV v.3.0 software module that converted these values to HR measured as beats per minute.


### HF-HRV

> HRV-HF was employed as the primary psychophysiological measure of interest. HRV-HF is a noninvasive index of parasympathetic nervous activity. HRV-HF has been associated with positive emotion functioning (e.g., Kok & Fredrickson, 2010; Porges, 1995; Oveis et al., 2009), and emotion regulation capacity (Butler et al., 2006) in general and in BD specifically (Gruber, 2011; Gruber et al., 2011b). HRV-HF refers to the natural variation in heart rate due to respiratory factors (Berntson et al., 1997; Grossman & Taylor, 2007). During inspiration, the heart period (distance between R-spikes) becomes smaller; during expiration the heart period increases. Specifically, the ECG signal was digitized (250 Hz) and IBI series was derived, and artifacts were identified and edited (Berntson et al., 1990, 1997) using AcqKnowledge v3.9 software.

> These individual R–R intervals were then exported into Mindware HRV v.3.0 software for analysis (Mindware Technologies, Inc., Gahanna, OH). Using a power spectrum approach, HRV-HF was quantified as the integral power within the respiratory frequency band (0.12 to 0.40 Hz; Berntson et al., 1997), which is a high frequency bandwidth used in as an indicator of parasympathetic activity (Porges, 1995). Higher HRVHFmean values denote greater parasympathetic activity, and higher HRV-HFSD values denote greater intra-individual variability in HRV-HF levels across time during the ESM sampling period.
