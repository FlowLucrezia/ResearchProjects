### Physiological Measurements

>Skin conductance and heart rate were measured using BioPac. Previous work has shown that these are useful signals of stress [7]. To measure skin conductance, electrodes were attached to the thenar and hypothenar eminences of each participants’ nondominant palm. To measure heart rate, electrodes were attached to the collarbone and ribs of each participant. Braithwaite, et al. [8] offer recommendations for using the BioPac and  ccompanying software to perform electrodermal measurement, which we followed.

>After the electrodes were attached to participants, a three-minute resting period was observed for each participant before he/she was instructed to start the experiment. Data was gathered at a rate of 1sample/msec. The electrodermal activity signal was recorded with a high band pass filter of 0Hz, and a low band pass filter of 35Hz, with a gain of 1000Hz. Skin conductance values are reported in microsiemens (μs). The electrocardiography signal was recorded with a high band pass filter set at 0.5 and a low band pass filter set at 35Hz, with a gain of 1000Hz. Heart rate was extracted from the raw ECG signal and is reported in beats per minute (bpm). Both the skin conductance and heart rate data were visually inspected for any errors or potential aberrant artifacts.
