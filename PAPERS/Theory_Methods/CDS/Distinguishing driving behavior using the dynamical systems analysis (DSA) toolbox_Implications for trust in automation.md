>The current study focuses on the utilization of the DSA toolbox in exploring, characterizing,and understanding human driving behavior in the context of a complex simulated driving task involvingautonomous driving systems. To adequately assess trust in automation, an important construct in human-autonomy teaming (HAT) modeling, we need to understand the dynamics of human behaviors underchanging environmental contexts and automation capability. The DSA framework allows for the systematicexamination of these complex interaction dynamics by analyzing behavioral time-series data. The resultsprovide insights into the presence of nested structures in behavioral signals, regions of interest wherefundamentally different behaviors take place, the location of spatial and temporal scales at which drivingdecisions are influenced, and the effects of automation use and quality on driving behavior.

>In this study, 16 participants completed a “leader-follower” task with an autonomous drivingsystem in a simulated environment. Each participant completed 5 trials at different levels of automationcapability. An array of perturbations increased participants’ workload and encouraged engagement with theautomation (see Gregmillion et al., 2016 for more details). This study focuses on analyzing the vehicle’sdeviations from the center of the lane in the context of automation usage and environmental features. ThreeDSA analyses were applied to the lane deviation data in sequence: Multifractal Detrended FluctuationAnalysis (MFDFA), Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), and Wavelet Coherence (WTC). Eachanalysis characterizes aspects of the driving behavior and informs the next appropriate step.Results and Discussion. The first analysis in the sequence, MFDFA (Kantelhardt et al., 2001), measures thelong-range dependency of fluctuations in the behavioral signal (e.g., how much instantaneous decisions of adriver to use automation are related statistically to their long-term driving patterns). Crucially, MFDFAalso examines whether this long-range dependence changes over time, indicating fundamentally differentdriving patterns. The results showed consistent high degree of long-range dependence and presence ofshifts in driving behaviors across all trials.

>This finding informed our next analysis: RQA (Marwan et al.,2002) for each of the course’s 9 Zones. This analysis quantifies the tendency of the system to revisit thesame behavioral patterns over time. An RQA analysis per Zone allows us to both locate and measuresections of the course where driving behavior changes. The results showed a significant shift in recurrencepatterns in one of the course’s challenging S-curve sections. This finding substantiated our interpretation ofthe MFDFA results and led to the third analysis: WTC (Grindsted et al., 2004). WTC allows researchers toprobe the relationship between two time series and localize behavioral changes in both time and frequency.Here, we examine the relationship between lane deviations and the curvature of the course. The WTCresults indicated a clear link between the S-curves and an increase in lane violations in the behavioral data,corroborating results from RQA. Lastly, repeated-measures Analysis of Variance of DSA measures showedconsistent effects of full control, high-quality automation on behavior and system dynamics. In conclusion,our analyses demonstrated that driving behavior is affected by both long-range and short-range processes,environmental course features, and automation when it is both capable and reliable
