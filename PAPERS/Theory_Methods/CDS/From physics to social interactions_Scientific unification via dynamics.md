### Fractal Methods for Nested Data Structures

> In the absence of conducting our psychological research in a vacuum, we recognize that we can never completely isolate a phenomenon from everything that influences it. Instead, the measurements that we make inherit the stamp of all of the other effects, both above and below the level of analysis, that have some influence. 

> Now let us consider concretely some real empirical data, specifically, electroencephalogram (EEG) data from individual team members (Stevens, Galloway, Wang, & Berka, 2012, Stevens, Galloway, et al., 2013; Stevens, Gorman, Amazeen, Likens, & Galloway, 2013) that formed the basis for a multifractal analysis of neural signatures of team (social) coordination (Likens, Amazeen, Stevens, Galloway, & Gorman, 2014). That analysis will be discussed shortly. Mimicking the structure of Figure 6, we see that the team resides at the social level but may be constrained by both slower processes at levels above the level of the group and smaller, faster processes. EEG signals came from team members who were engaged in Submarine Piloting And Navigation (SPAN) simulation task at the Naval Training Academy in Groton, CT. That means that team behavior observed during the training session was influenced by more slowly-changing processes like the training procedures of the Naval Training Academy and the broader mission and directives of the U.S. Navy. At the same time, team behavior was influenced by individual characteristics of team members, i.e, their cognitive, motor, respiratory, cardiac, and neurophysiological states.

> A significant feature of this data set was the assumption of bidirectional influence: For example, teams engaged in rhythmic tasks, like the "taking of Rounds", which consisted of a highly scripted reporting procedure that recurred every 3 minutes. It is highly likely that the presence of that recurring team-level task caused the neurophysiological states of individual team members to be correlated in some important way during the execution of that task. Their neurophysiological states may not have reflected the same level of coordination during times when they were not engaged in that common task. That assumption allowed us to expect that analysis of EEG signals at the level of measurement to reflect the state of the team at the social level. 

- peak in a power spectrum = contribution of a single frequency
- multiple peaks = multiple frequencies

>Fractal structure is identified by logarithmic decay across those spectral components; that is, all frequencies contribute to the observed series, but the energy accounted for by each frequency is inversely related—via a logarithm—to the size of that frequency. When transformed to logarithmic coordinates, the slope of the decay is -1; thus, the label 1/f noise.

- real phenomena show multiple scaling regions - scaling exponent characterizes relations across a range of scales or across a range of time

> ... wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM; Mallat, 1999; Muzy, Bacry, & Arneodo, 1993; Percival & Walden, 2000; Struzik, 2001) because of its ability to localize those exponent changes. WTMM replaces the spectral components used in PSD and other fractal analyses with analyzing wavelets that permit customization to characteristics of the signal being analyzed and promote the identification of singularities, or transition points. That allows for wavelet analysis to be used to locate meaningful events in both time and scale of analysis.

### Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima

> In the first step, a continuous wavelet transform is generated by translating a wavelet of a particular size across a time series to estimate wavelet coefficients, or correlations of the wavelet with the series, over time. The process is repeated with wavelets of different sizes to derive the same estimates across a range of scales. The output is a matrix of wavelet coefficients that can be depicted as a heat map with brightness used to refer to the value of the wavelet coefficient, or correlation of the analyzing wavelet to features in the original signal. In Figure 7b, brighter points identify strong positive correlations.

> Interpretation is most meaningful when we consider regions of color/brightness rather than each individual point, for it is those regions and that correspond to events. Coordinates of those events are given by time ("Epoch") on the horizontal axis and scale ("log2(scale)"), or the size of the analyzing wavelet, on the vertical axis. Those coordinates can be used to locate meaningful events in both time and scale of analysis. Branching indicates nesting of smaller, faster-moving events inside larger, slower-moving events that mimics the nested structure (Figure 6) that we expect gives rise to the fluctuations we observe in our measurements of human behavior.

> What is often lost in empirical reports is the story of how the analysis unfolded. What I find most remarkable about this particular analysis is the fact that we did not have access to the transcripts while we completed the multifractal analysis. We identified what we considered relevant features and our colleagues, who had the transcripts, looked up the times we identified to provide a match to our observations. What is immediately clear is that larger, brighter regions at the largest scales of Figure 7b are filled with branching that distinguishes events at smaller scales. At approximately Epoch 2800, the onset of debriefing is identified as a dark line that separates the largest scale events of Experimental Session and Debriefing. The impact of that debriefing pervades all scales of analysis, from the largest "session identity" to the smallest, momentary interactions. I mentioned previously the taking of Rounds, a recurring event for the team. The band of branching at log2 scale 6 corresponds to that rhythmic event. Finally, we notice an encapsulated event at approximately Epoch 1500 and log2 scale 8. Consultation of the transcript revealed a period of confusion for the team that resulted from a near-collision with another ship under conditions of reduced visibility.

> We recently submitted a paper that introduces a technique called Multiscale Lagged Regression Analysis (MLRA) that accomplishes both of those tasks (Likens, & Amazeen, submitted). Following the precedent of Kristoufek (2015), we apply detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), a multiscale method, across two data streams whose lagged relationship is varied systematically. In this way, we are able to determine the influence of one process on another across both spatial and temporal scale. Using the example above, this would enable us to measure both neurophysiological and social states and estimate directly the influence of each one on the other at different scales (momentary vs long-term) and over time (immediate vs delayed). The future direction of this research program is to track influences across both time and scale in the multivariate case, that is, for the very many nested processes (e.g., Figure 6) that contribute to the richness and complexity of human behavior.
