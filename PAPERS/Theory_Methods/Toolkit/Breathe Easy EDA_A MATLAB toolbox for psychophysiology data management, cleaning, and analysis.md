### Respiration & EDA

> It is well known that respiration and EDA influence each other (Schneider et al., 2003). In laboratory settings, researchers often leverage this relationship to check the integrity of a psychophysiology set-up. Asking participants to take a deep breath should produce concurrent deflections in both waveforms, and properly configured recording equipment should detect that response. EDA is typically recorded using electrodes placed on the palmar or plantar surfaces where eccrine sweat glands are densely located. Respiration, typically recorded using a belt secured around the diaphragm, is an oscillatory event that approximates a sine wave with regular breathing. However, irregular respiration, or abnormalities in the respiration waveform (frequency or amplitude), are associated with non-specific changes in the EDA waveform. These physiological respiration-related artifacts can lead researchers to overestimate the presence or magnitude of skin conductance responses (SCRs) in experiments (Schneider et al., 2003).
