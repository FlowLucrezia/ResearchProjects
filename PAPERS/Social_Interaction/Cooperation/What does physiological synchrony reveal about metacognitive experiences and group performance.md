What does physiological synchrony reveal about metacognitive experiences and group performance?. _British Journal of Educational Technology_, _51_(5), 1577-1596.](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjet.12981?casa_token=ZQLZfw8B4g0AAAAA%3A6vkD0kZw31b-0oH4j2ux7FbmWLCI6vBc-O-Y3TJNJl1AvCaysGptUBSJPoYoeDwzfncrrowwOgST6UY)

### EDA Processing

> Pre-processing of the EDA signal followed the steps of a commonly used approach (see eg, Di Lascio, Gashi, & Santini, [2018](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12981?saml_referrer#bjet12981-bib-0023)). First, the EDA data were visually inspected for clear signs of movement artefacts (eg, lost electrode contact seen as drops in the signal) and the artefacts found were corrected with Ledalab toolbox. 
> Second, the signals were downsampled to 4 hz with the purpose to make long recordings computable for recurrence quantification analysis without losing the dynamics of the signal. 
> Third, signals were standardised with the aim to make them comparable with each other (Ben-Shakhar, [1985](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12981?saml_referrer#bjet12981-bib-0009)). Standardisation has been successfully used for EDA (Ben-Shakhar, [1985](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12981?saml_referrer#bjet12981-bib-0009); Dawson _et al_., [2017](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12981?saml_referrer#bjet12981-bib-0021)) and is also suggested for MdRQA analysis to ensure that its measures are based on sequential similarity of the time-series’ (Wallot & Leonardi, [2018](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12981?saml_referrer#bjet12981-bib-0088)). 
> Fourth, phasic signal component was derived from the signal with Ledalab continuous decomposition analysis including adaptive smoothing of the signal (Benedek & Kaernbach, [2010](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12981?saml_referrer#bjet12981-bib-0008)).
> 
> Then, PS among the collaborating participants was calculated through a Multidimensional Recurrence Quantification Analysis (MdRQA). MdRQA is a non-linear time-series analysis that calculates the synchrony of multiple signals over time and can be used for autocorrelated and non-stationary data such as EDA (Wallot & Leonardi, [2018](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12981?saml_referrer#bjet12981-bib-0088); Wallot, Roepstorff, & Mønster, [2016](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12981?saml_referrer#bjet12981-bib-0090)). It has become a prominent technique for calculating temporal interdependence among the physiological signals of individuals doing collaborative work (Dindar _et al_., ([2019](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12981?saml_referrer#bjet12981-bib-0025)); Wallot, Mitkidis, _et al_., [2016](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12981?saml_referrer#bjet12981-bib-0089)). The synchrony in MdRQA refers to the time points at which the distance between multiple signals fall within a specific radius. Such time points are described in terms of “recurrence” (Wallot & Leonardi, [2018](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12981?saml_referrer#bjet12981-bib-0088)). Higher recurrence in a system indicates that the system exhibits a specific behaviour (eg, PS) to a higher extent over time. 
> Several MdRQA indices have been developed to quantify the recurrence characteristics of a system. The most common indices are Recurrence Rate Percentage (REC%), Determinism (DET), Average Diagonal Length (ADL) and Maximum Diagonal Length (MDL) (Shockley, Santana, & Fowler, [2003](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12981?saml_referrer#bjet12981-bib-0079)). REC% refers to the ratio of time points with recurrence to all time points. DET is the ratio of adjacent recurrence time points to all recurrence time points. ADL is the average length of adjacent recurrence time points. MDL is the length of longest adjacent time points with recurrence. The term “adjacent recurrence time points” refers to continuous PS among the collaborators.
