### Physiological Activation

> Since emotional activation dimension cannot be captured from the video recordings, video observations were supplemented with EDA data. A MySQL database was constructed to organize the EDA data. To begin, the data were downsampled from 128 to 16 Hz to accelerate the analysis (Kelsey et al., 2018). Any recordings in which electrode contact was missing were removed from the data set. A Butterworth low-pass filter (frequency 1, order 5) was used to remove small movement artefacts from the signal (Realtime Technologies Ltd, 2018). Non-specific skin conductance response (NS- SCR) peaks with a minimum amplitude of .05 μS were then identified in each student's signal, using the trough- to-peak method (Boucsein, 2012; Dawson et al., 2007). NS-SCR peaks were selected because they are strongly related to emotional response and are more sensitive than slowly varying skin conductance level (SCL) to variations in experimental conditions (Christopoulos et al., 2019 ; Dawson et al., 2007). In situations involving continuous stimuli (such as collaborative learning), frequency of NS-SCR peaks serves as an indicator of current arousal (Braithwaite et al., 2013). The threshold was set to .05 μS, since it is the most used (Braithwaite et al., 2013) and thus enabled the comparability of the peak detection results. Different methods for peak detection (continuous decomposition analysis and discrete decomposition analysis) available in Ledalab were first tested (Benedek & Kaernbach, 2010a, 2010b). Ultimately, the peaks were derived with the traditional trough-to-peak method because, even after several rounds of testing, decomposition-based methods seemed to provide unrealistically high frequency of peaks as a result.


### Group Valence and Activation

> From the video data, valence was coded as one of three categories (positive, negative, mixed) based on group members' emotional expressions. The academic emotions framework (Pekrun et al., 2002) and the affective circumplex model (Russell & Barrett, 1999) provided the theoretical basis for differentiating expressions of positive and negative affect. The video coding scheme was based on the authors' previous work (Törmänen et al., 2021a; Törmänen et al., 2021b ). Before proceeding to final coding, seven videos (10%) were coded by two researchers, and unclear cases were discussed to refine the coding scheme. Group valence was coded as positive when at least two group members expressed clear signs of positive affect or made a positive comment, and vice versa. In cases where valence was mixed within one group member (e.g., individual displayed a negative verbal expression and a positive bodily expression) or when two students' expressions conflicted (i.e., positive vs. negative), valence was coded as mixed (see Table 1 for examples). The interrater reliability analysis performed for 10% of the coded videos indicated substantial agreement (κ = .68) (Landis & Koch, 1977). Again, the discrepancies between the coders were discussed to agree on the final codes. The valence coding procedure is detailed in Table 1.

> Group activation during each socio-emotional interaction segment was measured in terms of EDA data, based on frequency of NS-SCR peaks for individual group members (Braithwaite et al., 2013). First, the frequency of NS-SCR peaks for each group member was calculated for every 30-s segment of collaboration. To account for the individual differences, the average number of peaks during one segment was then calculated for each group member separately, along with standard deviations; if the number of peaks during the segment was more than one standard deviation above the individual's average, the group member was considered to be in a state of high arousal. Individuals' limit values for high arousal varied between 5 and 9 peaks/30-s. Individual levels of arousal were then aggregated into a group-level activation variable. If all group members were in a state of low arousal, group-level activation was categorized as low; if some group members were in a state of high arousal, group-level activation was categorized as divergent, and if all group members were in a state of high arousal, group- level activation was categorized as high.
