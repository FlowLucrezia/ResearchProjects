### Electrodermal Activity

> Arousal at a certain time instant (with a resolution of 250 ms, the sampling interval of the sensor) was operationalized as the count of skin conductance response (SCR; peak in the EDA signal) onsets during the previous min. Ledalab (version 3.4.9; http://www.ledalab.de/) software, based on MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA.), was used for EDA signal processing as recommended by the wristband manufacturer (Empatica Inc., 2015). The Ledalab algorithm assumes raw, unfiltered data as the input for decomposition analysis and feature extraction of the EDA signal (Benedek & Kaernbach, 2010). Therefore, no signal preprocessing, such as cleaning or filtering, was performed on the EDA signal as obtained from the wristband sensor. Continuous decomposition analysis (Benedek & Kaernbach, 2010) was used for extracting SCRs (peaks), as it enables separate detection of superimposed responses. This is important to obtain an unbiased measure since, more often than not, a subsequent SCR occurs during the decay of a previous one. In addition, one must decide on the amplitude threshold beyond which a change in conductance will be considered an SCR. A choice was made for 0.05 μS, which is the customary minimum amplitude used in EDA research (Braithwaite, Watson, Jones, & Rowe, 2015; Dawson et al., 2017). After continuous decomposition analysis, onsets for each individual SCR were obtained in Ledalab. Onsets served as the basis to subsequently calculate the SCR frequency minute-wise, using a moving window approach with a window width of 1 min and a moving step of 250 ms—the sampling interval of the sensor. Thus, the SCR frequency during the lesson was obtained for every time instant (resolution of 250 ms) after the first min of the lesson, as it corresponded to the number of SCR onsets in the previous min. Since no amplitude measure was considered, no correction in the form of standardization was needed for comparison across individuals.

> SCR frequency was used to categorize arousal into low, medium, and high levels. Typically, a frequency of 1–3 ppm (peaks/min) occurs at rest (Dawson et al., 2017, p. 225), and, as frequency increases with the arousal level, values higher than 20 ppm are interpreted as high arousal (Boucsein, 2012, p. 222). Accordingly, frequencies of up to 3 ppm were labelled as low arousal, from 20 ppm up were labelled as high arousal, and anything between these two values was labelled as medium arousal.

> Using the minimum of 1 ppm as the worst case, we discarded from the analysis all the EDA recording sessions where the total number of SCR detected was less than 1 ppm times the lesson duration in min. In that way, we automatically excluded sessions where improper electrode-skin contact, due to wristband maladjustment, basically led to the measurement of noise rather than actual EDA signal. This devised technique served as a convenient aid to the manual visual inspection, recommended as the starting point for EDA analysis (Braithwaite et al., 2015)
