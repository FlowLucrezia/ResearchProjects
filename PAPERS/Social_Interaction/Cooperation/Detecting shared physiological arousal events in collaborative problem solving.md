### SCR Processing

> SPAE is based on the common SCR peak detection method used in physiological research. An SCR is characterized by a steep incline followed by an [exponential decline](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/exponential-decline "Learn more about exponential decline from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in the electrodermal activity signal ([Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#f0010)) ([Benedek & Kaernbach, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0025)). The SCR peaks refer to heightened physiological arousal in the body. An SCR peak occurs within 1 to 5 s following the presentation of a stimuli ([Dawson et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0070)). In the [time series](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/time-series "Learn more about time series from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") electrodermal activity data, the exact time point of the SCRs can be calculated using several standardized methods such as peak-to-peak detection ([Boucsein, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0030)). In the current study, the SCRs were detected with the Ledalab toolbox ([Benedek & Kaernbach, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0025)). Before the detection, a Butterworth [low pass filter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/lowpass-filter "Learn more about low pass filter from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") with a frequency of 1 Hz and order 5 was used to remove the small movement artifacts from the signal ([Kelsey et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0230)). Then, SCRs with a minimum amplitude of 0.05 μS were detected using classic trough-to-peak analysis.

### Shared Physiological Events

> In this study, the correspondence between the SCRs of the team members is referred to as the SPAE. We define SPAE as a time window in which an SCR is manifested by all the team members. As seen in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#f0010), a latency occurs between a stimuli/event and the SCR to that stimuli/event. This latency differs from one individual to another. Thus, it is highly unlikely that the SCRs of collaborating team members would occur at the exact same time point. Consequently, we define SPAE as a time window not a time point.

> To decide on the optimum time window for [SPAE detection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/event-detection "Learn more about SPAE detection from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), we followed a data-driven, three-step approach. In the first step, we calculated the SPAE counts for each team for 20 different time windows. The time windows ranged from 0.25 s to 5 s with an increment of 0.25 s in each consecutive calculation. The increment value was based on sampling frequency (i.e., 4 Hz = 4 measurements per second). The minimum and maximum time window was based on the the [maximum latency](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/maximum-latency "Learn more about maximum latency from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") between the stimuli and the SCR suggested in the literature ([Dawson et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0070)). For each time window, the SPAE count was calculated by moving the window from the beginning to the end of the [time series data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/time-series-data "Learn more about time series data from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), within steps of 0.25 s (i.e., by each measurement point). Considering that the teams completed the CPS task in different amounts of time, we calculated the SPAE count/minute scores for each time window to make the findings comparable among the different teams ([Boucsein, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0030)). In the second step, we created a surrogate dataset by randomly shuffling the [SCR time](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/response-time "Learn more about SCR time from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") points for each team member ([Lancaster, Iatsenko, Pidde, Ticcinelli, & Stefanovska, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0255)). Similar to the first step, we then calculated the SPAE count/minute for the surrogate teams for 20 different time windows (0.25 s to 5 s). In the third step, we compared the SPAE count/minute scores of the actual and surrogate teams for each time window with [independent samples](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/independent-sample "Learn more about independent samples from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") t-tests. This allowed us to detect the optimum time window for SPAE detection.


### Theoretical Background

> In the literature, the contradictory findings of the association between physiological synchrony and collaborative learning constructs can be considered to support to our argument. For example, some studies reported a [positive relationship](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/positive-relationship "Learn more about positive relationship from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") between physiological synchrony and team cohesion ([Mønster, Håkonsson, Eskildsen, & Wallot, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0270)), cognitive regulation ([Dindar et al., 2020c](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0095)), mental effort ([Dindar et al., 2020b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0090)), task control ([Montague, Xu, & Chiou, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0275)), and perceived task difficulty ([Wallot, Mitkidis, McGraw, & Roepstorff, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0380)). Some studies reported a [negative relationship](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/negative-relationship "Learn more about negative relationship from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") between physiological synchrony and team cohesion ([Strang, Funke, Russell, Dukes, & Middendorf, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0360)), effective [team communication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/team-communication "Learn more about team communication from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Henning, Armstead, & Ferris, 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0170)), and [negative emotions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/negative-emotion "Learn more about negative emotions from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Mønster et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0270)). Others reported no relationship between physiological synchrony and perceived task difficulty, task interest, or emotions ([Dindar et al., 2020b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0090)). Furthermore, the literature on the association between physiological synchrony and team task performance varied between a positive relationship ([Arthur et al., 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0005), [Elkins et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0105)), a negative relationship ([Dich et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0075), [Strang et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0360), [Wallot et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0380)) and no relationship ([Dindar et al., 2020b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0090); [Wiltshire, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X22000091?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-7&rr=8e8415df4894a71b#b0390)).
