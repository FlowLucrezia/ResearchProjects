### Electrodermal Activity

>EDA data was collected using Empatica E4 wristbands at a frequency of 4Hz (four samples per second). Each raw EDA time series was decomposed into phasic and tonic component time series by Continuous Decomposition Analysis (CDA) using the Ledalab toolbox (Benedek & Kaernbach, 2010). Each phasic and tonic time series was smoothed using a moving average, similar to CAID-coding, with a previous 10-second window. To enable comparison with the CAID data, we aggregated 1-second level data from the running mean series by calculating the mean of all samples in each second. Each time series was standardized to Z-values to reduce inter-subject variability.

>As the phasic series primarily describes reactions to situational (external) events, there are more peaks and variations among the values than in the tonic component. The tonic component indicates the intensity of internal sympathetic state (Greco et al., 2016) and hence it is used in further analyses to determine the intensity for each student in collaborative group work. The tonic component is not subject to transient momentary events in the environment, but is instead reflective of psychological arousal and sympathetic nervous system activation. It is natural for the tonic component to rise relatively fast and decrease more gradually (Qasim et al., 2022).
