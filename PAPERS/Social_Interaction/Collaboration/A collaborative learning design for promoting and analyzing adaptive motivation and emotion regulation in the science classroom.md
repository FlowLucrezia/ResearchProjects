### Electrodermal Activity

> EDA data can be analyzed on both the individual and the group level, which provides possibilities for analyzing the socio-emotional aspects of collaborative learning. One dimension of the EDA measurement is the participants' slowly varying tonic skin conductance level (SCL) ([Dawson et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.00111/full#B24); [Boucsein, 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.00111/full#B17)). In the case example, EDA data during 51-min period of collaborative learning is presented for each student. The tonic SCL level of each student measured during collaboration is visible in colored lines in [Figure 4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.00111/full#F4). The example data was processed using MATLAB based software Ledalab ([http://www.ledalab.de/](http://www.ledalab.de/)). As the Shimmer3 GSR+ sensors produce data with the sampling rate of 128 Hz, the data was first down sampled into 16 Hz. The raw data was then decomposed into tonic and phasic components using continuous decomposition analysis ([Benedek and Kaernbach, 2010b](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.00111/full#B12)). The example shows that Student 1, who indicates a higher level of interest on the trait-type self-report and a high, increasing activation level related to her emotional state in 6Q, shows both a high maximum level of SCL (54 μS) and high variation in SCL within the session. The two other students' SCL range, however, follows the degree of variation defined as normal in prior research (2–20 μS; [Dawson et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.00111/full#B24)).

> Another way to define students' arousal level is through the phasic short-term skin conductance response (SCR) peaks visualized in [Figure 5](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.00111/full#F5) by the green, yellow, and red boxes under the SCL lines. SCR peaks are strongly associated with emotional responses caused by an external stimulus and are more reactive to variation than SCL ([Dawson et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.00111/full#B24); [Christopoulos et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.00111/full#B20)). In situations with continuous stimuli, such as collaborative learning, the frequency of SCRs can be used as an indicator of the current arousal state ([Dawson et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.00111/full#B24); [Blascovich et al., 2011](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.00111/full#B14); [Braithwaite et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.00111/full#B18)). In the case example, the data was first smoothed out using an adaptive Gaussian filter and SCRs were then detected using the classical trough-to-peak technique ([Benedek and Kaernbach, 2010a](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.00111/full#B11)). Next, the number of peaks in each 1-min segment was calculated to define student's level of arousal in each minute: at rest, a frequency of 1–3 peaks/min occurs ([Dawson et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.00111/full#B24)), and frequencies higher than 20 peaks/min are considered as high arousal ([Boucsein, 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.00111/full#B17)). While the students' SCL level could be used to follow individual group members' physiological arousal (in relation to other members), the SCR peaks could be beneficial in, for example, locating emotionally relevant, short-term high-arousal situations on a group level to be further investigated with qualitative data sources, such as video data, particularly when operating with a large amount of data. For example, in the case example, we would be interested in targeting the 14-min high-arousal episode to explore socioemotional interactions and possible challenges that could lead to the need for regulation and, further, actualized co- and socially shared motivation or emotion regulation.
