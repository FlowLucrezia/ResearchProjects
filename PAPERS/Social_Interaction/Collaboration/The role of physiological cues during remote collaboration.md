### Baseline

> After the assessor was fitted with the physiological sensors, a three-minute baseline recording was performed using a customized Biograph Infiniti physiology measurement script. The assessor relaxed in a sitting position while focusing on a distant nature scene outside the window. We ensured that relaxation allowed the physiological readings to reach the baseline levels respecting the different amounts of time that participants needed for this before starting the baseline recording.
### Physiological Measurements

>We used Procomp hardware and Biograph Infiniti software from Thought Technology2 to measure the assessor’s Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), Blood Pressure (BP), and Respiratory Rate (RR). All these sensors were attached to the fingers on the nondominant hand of the assessor to reduce noise contamination. The GSR was measured on the last two fingers at 10 Hz. The blood pressure was measured on the middle finger at 10 Hz. A belt was attached above the abdomen to measure the chest expansion for respiratory rate. The chest expansion was sampled at 60 Hz.

>The measurement for each physiological modality was obtained from a customized Biograph physiological measurement script and subsequently computed as animations for visual representation. To overcome the limited range of physiological responses, we normalized the physiological signal for each modality with scale differences as a function of each participant. For example, certain participants who exhibited higher variability in a physio logical variable than others were transformed on the measures of scale calibration for equal means and standard deviations. We applied logarithmic transformation on the data to equalize variances and differences across conditions, and produced a scale that has linear proper ties to maintain the effects to be proportional to the original value.
