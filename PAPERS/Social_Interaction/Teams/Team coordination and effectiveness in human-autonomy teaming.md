### Dynamic Systems Tools

> In this study, the following analyses were applied to understand different characteristics of team coordination dynamics. 
> 1) Attractor reconstruction to visualize the dynamics of the teams by using a к score at the team level. 
> 2) Stability analysis (Lyapunov exponents) for each coordination order parameter к at the team level. 
> 3) Surrogate analysis to address whether the observed dynamics were an artifact of the short к time series or occurred randomly. 
> 4) Joint recurrence quantification analysis (JRQA) to extract the % determinism (DET) measure on the multivariate TCF measure.
