> In this study, we applied multifractal analysis to study the time-dependence of inter-beat interval (IBI) in light of a human-machine team (HMT) task process and examined how the Hölder exponent of IBI changed across individual team members over time. Another layer of an HMT is trust in a teammate, which is dynamic and emerges through the interaction between the team members (Demir et al., 2021); therefore, it needs to be predicted by interaction-based real-time physiological and psychological measures (Huang et al., 2020)... In this study, we analyzed the trust data with a focus on one of those EFA factors, i.e., “trust that human team member put in the AI pilot,” to examine the relationship between the Hölder exponent of IBI and trust.
