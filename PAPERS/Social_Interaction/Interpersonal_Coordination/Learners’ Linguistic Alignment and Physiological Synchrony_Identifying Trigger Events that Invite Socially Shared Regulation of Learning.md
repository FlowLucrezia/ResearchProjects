### Physiological Synchrony

>...  physiological data (EDA) were collected with physiological Shimmer GSR3+ sensors. The sensors were synchronized before each session and attached to the participants’ non-dominant hands so that gel electrodes were placed on the thenar and hypothenar eminences on their palms (Dawson et al., 2016).
>
>To answer RQ2 about physiological synchrony, we first detected the skin conductance responses (SCR) from the EDA data using the Ledalab toolbox (Benedek & Kaernbach, 2010). The signals were visually inspected for a lack of electrode contact, and we then removed small movement artifacts from the signal by applying the Butterworth low pass filter with frequency 1 and order 5. We used a threshold of 0.05 μS for detecting SCR peaks using continuous decomposition analysis (Benedek & Kaernbach, 2010; Society for Psychophysiological Research Ad Hoc Committee on Electrodermal Measures, 2012).

>After we had identified the peaks, we analyzed the shared physiological arousal events using the method developed by Dindar et al. (2022). We operationalized the events of physiological synchrony with high arousal by detecting the peaks of SCR and considered SCR peaks to co-occur within the group if they were manifested within a time window of 1.5 seconds by all the group members (Dindar et al., 2022). In addition to the events of physiological synchrony with high arousal, we detected the events of physiological synchrony with low arousal whenever no SCR peaks were manifested by any group members within the 1.5 second time window. Finally, if a group was not in synchrony with high or low arousal, we assumed it to be physiologically out of synchrony.
