### Cardiac Activity

> Each participant’s ECG signal was analyzed in MindWare Technology’s HRV application sofware, version 3.1.4. Visual inspection and manual editing of the data were completed by trained graduate students to ensure the proper removal of artifacts and ectopic beats90. Te ECG signal was amplifed by a gain of 1000 and fltered with a hamming windowing function. Due to measurement artifacts, we were unable to use ECG data for four participants. Te IBI series was later spline interpolated using MATLAB 2019a (Te MathWorks, Inc.) for every 500 milliseconds to obtain an equal interval time series. IBI represents the time in milliseconds between two heartbeats. Tus, as heart rate increases, IBI decreases. IBI is considered to be regulated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the ANS.

> The continuous IBI time series for each group member was later inputted to MATLAB, and a time-domain time-series analysis91–93 of the cross-correlation function (CCF) was employed. We defned a temporal lag of 3seconds [data point lag=−6 to +6] for the CCF to fnd the maximum dyadic correlations of IBI data between all pairs of group members. Te results of the CCF analyses enabled us to assess the maximal degree of synchronicity between each dyad’s time series. Tus, the IBI cross-correlation between each of the three dyads in the group was captured. In Figures S1 and S2, we present detailed descriptive statistics regarding the dyad-level correlations computed from the CCF analyses. A group synchronization score was calculated as the mean of each group’s three dyadic maximum correlations. CCF analyses have been extensively utilized in research to examine the bivariate coupling strength in continuous data, specifcally for IBI and heart rate.
