[Tomashin, A., Gordon, I., & Wallot, S. (2022). Interpersonal physiological synchrony predicts group cohesion. _Frontiers in human neuroscience_, _16_, 903407.](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2022.903407/full)

> In a previous study, we found IBI synchrony was related to a sense of group cohesion and predicted behavioral coordination in group members ([Gordon et al., 2020b](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2022.903407/full#B22)). A recent meta-analysis of the outcomes of physiological synchrony ([Mayo et al., 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2022.903407/full#B42)) pointed to an overall positive effect of IBI synchrony on group outcomes such as cohesion, commitment, and performance.

### Coherence

> Group cohesion was measured using four items of the widely used questionnaire by [Podsakoff and MacKenzie (1995)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2022.903407/full#B49). Each participant responded how well he or she can relate to the following statements on a 1–6 Likert scale: “If possible, I would be happy to participate in another group experiment with the members of my current work group”; “My group worked together as a team”; “We were cooperative with each other”; and “We knew that we could rely on one another” and “We were supportive.” Individual’s experience of group cohesion was calculated as the average of the above scores.

### ECG 

> Electrocardiograms were obtained from group members using a modified lead-II configuration. Respiratory data were derived from the standard tetrapolar electrode procedure for the impedance cardiogram described elsewhere ([Sherwood et al., 1990](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2022.903407/full#B58)). Electrodes were transmitting synchronously and wirelessly to the control room at a sampling rate of 500 Hz. Electrocardiograms were analyzed in MindWare Technology’s HRV 3.1.4 application and amplified by a gain of 1,000 and filtered with a hamming windowing function. Trained coders in the lab reviewed data manually and visually inspected all data to ensure the removal of artifacts and ectopic beats ([Berntson et al., 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2022.903407/full#B5)). Inter-beat-intervals (IBI) were extracted from the continuous ECG data. Note that IBI time series differed in length across individuals. Hence, for the purpose of correlating IBI data between members of dyads or groups, we had to trim the longer time series to the shortest time series length for each particular dyad or group. This was done by removing the excess data points at the end of the longer series.
