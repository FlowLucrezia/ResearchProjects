### Physiological Data

> A BIOPAC MP150 system with amplifiers for EDA (GSR100C), ECG (ECG100C) and EMG (EMG100C) was used to simultaneously record physiological data from all three participants.2 Since participants needed both hands free for the experimental task EDA signals were recorded with electrodes (BIOPAC EL507 electrodes pre-gelled with isotonic gel) placed on the pantar surface of one of each participant's feet, which is recommended as an alternative to planar measurements [33,34]. The negative electrode also provided grounding for the ECG and EMG measurements on the same participant. ECG was recorded with BIOPAC EL504 reusable electrodes with Ag/AgCl gel. One electrode was attached on each side of the participants' thorax at the height of the lower sternum....

> Data were recorded with the BIOPAC MP150 system, using an LED to synchronize the data time with the time code in a video camera used to record the experimental session. Research assistants later used the video recordings to code all relevant experimental events using this common time base.

### Data Processing

> The ECG signals for the three participants in each group were recorded simultaneously and digitized at 1 kHz. The ECG data were subsequently band-pass filtered between 0.5 Hz and 25 Hz to remove noise, and inspected for artifacts. The filtered ECG signal was converted to a heart rate signal by the built-in rate detection algorithm in BIOPAC Acqknowledge 4. The skin conductance signals were digitized at a sampling rate of 125 Hz with the GSR100C electrodermal amplifier working in DC mode with the low-pass filter set to 1 Hz. A phasic EDA signal was computed from the tonic signal recorded by using the built-in algorithm in BIOPAC Acqknowledge 4 based on a 0.05 Hz high-pass filter. 
> 
> All signals were downsampled to 3.90625 Hz (1 kHz/256 = 125 Hz/32 = 3.90625 Hz) to give a manageable data rate for the subsequent analyses.
