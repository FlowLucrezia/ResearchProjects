## Key Notes
- cross-correlations used to measure physiological linkage in dyads
- compared co-located vs separate dyads

## Findings

> Technological augmentation provides emotional cues and socially utilizable information, and affects intragroup emotions especially when regular communication is somehow limited. For example, text chat is effective when talking is prohibited or considered disturbing (like during movie watching), and sharing indices of group's shared physiological synchrony is effective when the group members are physically separated from each other. In a sense, these technical solutions compensate for the lack of emotional cues and information that exist in typical face-to-face communication.

## Methods

### HR Linkage

> HR data was first resampled to 32 Hz. Unrealistic values (3 standard deviations from mean, considering only values between 45 and 145 bpm) were replaced by interpolation. Cubic splines were used for both interpolation and resampling. Frequencies below 0.04 Hz were filtered out by removing a moving average cubic polynomial component from each individual data series. Resultant data series were smoothed with cubic polynomial in a 500 ms time window, and series mean was removed from each participant's data. 
> 
> When quantifying the HR linkage between the two members of each dyad, to allow some temporal lag between the physiological reactions, a ± 5-s temporal window was used in calculating the cross correlations (between the dyad members) for each HR sample (we assumed that the co-occurrence of physiological reactions with a longer temporal lag than 5 s is unlikely to be related to social processes). The highest cross-correlation value within this window was selected for the analysis. Mean cross-correlation coefficients were calculated separately for each film. Finally, Fisher transformation was applied to normalize the distribution of resultant values.
