### Theory

> Imagine two metronomes whose kinematics are coupled through a physical medium such as a sliding platform (Figure 3a). Provided that their frequencies are sufficiently similar, and coupling is sufficiently strong, the beats of the metronomes will tend to synchronize over time (Kelso, 1981; Strogatz & Mirollo, 1991). The phase-coupled oscillations that result from these interacting forces can be seen as idealized forms of behavioral matching, and a number of dyadic interaction studies have drawn this parallel (for a review, see Schmidt & Richardson, 2008).

>Now imagine two sets of metronomes at each end of the platform (Figure 3b) whose resonant frequencies span a wide range of timescales and do not correspond one-to-one across the two ends of the platform. Coupling may still yield a system for which synchronization is an inherently low energy state, but synchronization and other simple phase relations may no longer be sufficiently strong attractors to create stable dynamical states of the system. This is more likely to be true especially when coupling is relatively weak. In such cases, the system instead is prone to exhibiting intermittent, irregular transitions from one metastable state to the next (Kelso, 1995). Such complex dynamics are readily observable in systems as simple as coupled oscillators, and coupled oscillators provide only a simple model of human interlocutors. Thus the metronomes serve to illustrate how complex couplings are not exotic or rare but, rather, are quite expected for interactions between such richly heterogeneous systems like humans. Expectations of phase couplings and more complex couplings lead us to predict behavioral matching and complexity matching in human interactions.
