### Hypotheses

> Just as DFA, MF-DFA allows to select the range of intervals over which exponents are estimated. Usually, authors consider intervals from 8 or 10 data points, in order to allow a proper assessment of statistical moments, up to _N_/4 or _N_/2 (_N_ representing the length of the analyzed series), in order to get at least four or two estimates of these moments. Quite often, however, series present different scaling regimes over the short and the long term, and authors perform separate estimates over different ranges of intervals (Delignières and Marmelat [2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-016-4679-4#ref-CR7 "Delignières D, Marmelat V (2014) Strong anticipation and long-range cross-correlation: application of detrended cross-correlation analysis to human behavioral data. Phys Stat Mech Its Appl 394:47–60")). Here, we propose to estimate the set of multifractal exponents in first over the entire range of available intervals (i.e., from 8 to _N_/2) and then over more restricted ranges, progressively excluding the shortest intervals (i.e., from 16 to _N_/2, from 32 to _N_/2, and then from 64 to _N_/2). We expect to find in both cases (local corrections or global matching), a strong correlation pattern between exponents when considering long length intervals (i.e., 64–_N_/2).

> If synchronization is just based on local corrections, we consider that this close statistical matching in long intervals is just the consequence of the short-term, local coupling between the two systems. As local corrections between unpredictable systems remain approximate, we hypothesize that correlations should dramatically decrease when intervals of shorter durations are taken into consideration. In contrast, in the case of genuine complexity matching, the synchronization between systems is supposed to emerge from interactions across multiple scales. We then hypothesize to find in this case close correlations, even when considering the entire range of intervals, from the shortest to the longest.

> We finally computed for each q value, the correlation between the individual Lipschitz–Hölder exponents characterizing the two coordinated systems, α1(q) and α2(q), respectively, yielding a correlation function r(q). As previously explained, we expected to find in all cases a correlation function close to 1, for all q values, when only the largest intervals are considered. Increasing the range of considered intervals should have a negligible impact on r(q) when coordination is based on a complexity matching effect. In contrast, if coordination is based on local corrections, a decrease in r(q) should be observed, as shorter and shorter intervals are considered.
